Non-Volatile Memory Crash Test Tool (NVCT) is a PIN-based crash simulator. The tool simulates a multi-level cache hierarchy with cache coherence and main memory; NVCT also includes a random crash generator, a set of APIs to support the configuration of crash tests and application restart, and a component to examine data inconsistency for post-crash analysis. 


--------------------------------------------------
	Supported platform
--------------------------------------------------
1. Linux x86_64

--------------------------------------------------
	Requirements	
--------------------------------------------------

0. Ensure you have g++ 4.8.2 or higher as the default compiler and make sure you compile everything with -std=c++11 flag

1. Download and install the latest Pin framework matching your platform from
http://www.pintool.org/downloads.html. In case you don't download Pin, our build script has an option to automatically download from WWW.
* I have tested the current release only on Pin 2.14 rev 71313 *


--------------------------------------------------
	Compiling
--------------------------------------------------

0. To build the environment for Non-Volatile Memory Crash Test Tool, simply type "sh build.sh"
   This will configure the environment of building Non-Volatile Main Memory Crash Test Tool. 

1. Type "make" to build NVCT and related library

If there is PIN test error during building the NVCT: 
* To fix pin general issue, get root access and run "echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope"

If there is issue about using c++11 to compile:
* Change PIN setting and enable c++11, "vim /pin-2.14-71313-gcc.4.4.7-linux/source/tools/Config/makefile.unix.config".
   In line 84 "TOOL_CXXFLAGS_NOOPT", adding "-std=c++11" at the end of the line.

If you want to recompile NVCT instead of any other libraies:
* In test folder, run "make"
   This will build the NVCT
   
--------------------------------------------------
	How to run NVCT
--------------------------------------------------
The cache simulator code is in folder "tests". Before run NVCT, change cache configuration first in "tests/dcache.cpp" or by adding KNOB command flag in PIN.

A. Change code in tests/dcache.cpp:
	The maxmium number of instruction crash could happens:      line 57   INS_MAX
	The maxmium number of thread application use:               line 62   MAX_THREAD_NUM

B. Knob command flag:
	```
	-t   how many thread using in application
	-p   private cache num, atmost two thread have one private cache
	-s1  l1 cache size in kilobytes
	-a1  l1 cache associativity (1 for direct mapped)
	-l1  l1 cacheline size in bytes
	-s2  l2 cache size in kilobytes
	-a2  l2 cache associativity (1 for direct mapped)
	-l2  l2 cacheline size in bytes
	-s3  l3 cache size in kilobytes
	-a3  l3 cache associativity (1 for direct mapped)
	-l3  l3 cacheline size in bytes
	```

Run NVCT:
The command to run NVCT is:
/home/cc/NVC/pin-2.14-71313-gcc.4.4.7-linux/intel64/bin/pinbin -p32 /home/cc/tools/NVC/pin-2.14-71313-gcc.4.4.7-linux/ia32/bin/pinbin -t obj-intel64//dcache.so -- /path/to/application 

Crash test for application with single thread can simply use script in folder "tests"
E.g. ./run /path/to/application

Documentation of NVCT's key APIs 
--------------------------------------------------

1. void start_crash(); void end_crash();
	Description: 
   		Define where a crash could happen.
		A crash could happen within the code region encapsulated by the two APIs.
	Arguments:
		None
2. void critical_data(void const *p, char type[], int const size); 
	Description:
		Collect the address, type and size information of a critical data object.
	Arguments:
		p: critical data object address.
		type: critical data object type, can be CHAR, INT, FLOAT, DOUBLE, LONG LONG 
                size: critical data object size.

3. void cache_line_write_back(void const *p);
	Description:
		Writes back a dirty cache line containing the address p, and marks the cache line as clean in the cache hierarchy.
		This API is used to emulate CLWB.
	Arguments:
		p: the address need to be written back.

4. void flush_cache_line(void const *p);
	Description:
		Flush a cache line containing address p, invalidate this cache line from every level of the cache hierarchy in the cache coherence domain. 
		This API is used to emulate CLFLUSH and CLFLUSHOPT.
		
5. void flush_whole_cache();
	Description:
		writes back all modified cache lines in the processor's internal cache to main memory and does not invalidate (flush) the internal caches. 
		This API is used to emulate WBNOINVD

6. void write_back_invalidate_cache();
	Description:
		 Writes back all dirty cache lines in the processor\textquotesingle s cache to main memory and invalidates (flushes) the cache hierarchy. 
		 This API is used to emulate WBINVD.

6. bool read_cache(void *dst, void const *src, size_t size);
	Description:
		 Read specified number of bytes in simulated cache from a source address to a destination address. 
		 The function returns whether the data in source address is in simulated cache.

7. bool read_memory(void *dst, void const *src, size_t size);
	Description:
		 Read specified number of bytes in simulated memory from a source address to a destination address. 
		 The function returns whether the data in source address is in simulated memory.

Example to use 
---------------------------------------------------
We provide few examples to show how to use NVCT to trigger a crash and recompute based on carsh result. 
The crash examples can be found under "Benchmarks/CrashTests"; 
The recomputation examples can be found under "Benchmarks/Recomputation".


---------------------------------------------------
Useful scripts
---------------------------------------------------
NVC provides some scripts for doing large amount of crash tests and recompuation tests at the same time by lerveraging Linux screen.
The scripts can be found under "Scripts"


---------------------------------------------------
General issues
---------------------------------------------------
        
> There is a known problem of using Pin on Linux systems that prevent the use
> of ptrace attach via the sysctl /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope.
> In this case Pin is not able to use its default (parent) injection mode.
> To resolve this, either use the "-injection child" option or 
> set the kernel/yama/ptrace_scope sysctl to 0.

So what we do is geting root access and seting the kernel/yama/ptrace_scope sysctl to 0

echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
