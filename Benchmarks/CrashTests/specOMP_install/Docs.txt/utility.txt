Introduction

   This document describes various useful utilities that ship with SPEC
   OMP2012. It is assumed that you have already read runspec.html and
   config.html.

    On Windows Systems

   Most of the examples in this document have been written in Unix syntax.
   That means you'll need to use your imagination just a bit as you read this
   document:

   If you see:     Just pretend you saw:
         cat               type
         cp                copy
        diff                fc
        grep              findstr
         ls                 dir
          /                  \
        $SPEC             %spec%

configpp

   "configpp" is a short way to say:

    $ runspec --action configpp

   That switch is mentioned in runspec.html but you'll find much more about
   the config file preprocessor in config.html. The configuration file is
   specified using the --config switch, or -c for short, at the command line.
   For example, the following two command are equivalent:

    $ runspec --action configpp  -c try_utilities.cfg
    $ configpp -c try_utilities.cfg

   There are a couple of points worth mentioning here:

    1. The preprocessed configuration file will be dumped to stdout. But the
       normal progress output from runspec also goes to stdout, so the config
       file output will be delimited by two lines of hyphens.
    2. There's no need to specify benchmarks to run.
    3. As always, if you don't explicitly specify a config file via '-c
       <filename>', then the file default.cfg will be used.

   The configpp utility is a good way to check your configuration file for
   fatal errors, as the config file is completely parsed before it's output.

convert_to_development

   The "convert_to_development" utility removes various safety checks that
   ensure that benchmark code, data, and tools haven't been modified. This
   utility is useful if you are pursuing experimental changes that you would
   like to try out while still continuing to use the SPEC tool harness. For
   example, you might want to add your own performance instrumentation code,
   add some debugging code, or try out a modified workload.

   To use it, type:

      convert_to_development                  <--- Unix
      specperl bin\convert_to_development     <--- Windows

   A development tree cannnot be used for reportable runs.

   Benchmark binaries built in one type of tree (reportable or development)
   cannot be used in the other type unless you set check_md5=0. Note that
   even in a development tree, the default for check_md5 remains 1.

   Warning 1: If you use this utility, you will permanently render the
   current SPEC directory tree incapable of doing reportable runs. If you are
   doing both development work and reportable runs, install the suite twice
   in two different directory trees (for example, on different disks).

   Warning 2: Because benchmark binaries built in a reportable tree cannot be
   used in a development tree (unless you set check_md5=0), care should be
   taken to avoid accidental deletion and rebuilding of benchmark binaries.
   Consider the following scenario, where the user only wanted to try
   changing input files from the workload of 360.ilbdc:

   Probably not what you meant:

   $ runspec --config myconfig --action build 360.ilbdc
   $ convert_to_development
      Modify the workload for 360.ilbdc to try out some idea,
      changing files in 360.ilbdc/data/ref/input
   $ runspec --config myconfig --action validate 360.ilbdc
   ...
   Building 360.ilbdc base

   Unless myconfig.cfg contains check_md5=0, the effect of the above command
   will be to immediately rebuild 360.ilbdc, which probably isn't your intent
   if you are only studying the effects of workload modifications for
   360.ilbdc.

dumpsrcalt

   SPEC distributes approved source changes in packages referred to as
   src.alts, which are applied using the config file src.alt option. In
   config.html, you will also find an example showing what happens when one
   is applied.

   The dumpsrcalt tool allows you to find out what's in a src.alt without
   necessarily having to apply it.

   dumpsrcalt takes a packaged src.alt, an installed src.alt, or just the
   src.alt description file (srcalt.pm) and outputs the source changes as a
   unified diff file, which shows "-" for lines that are removed and "+" for
   lines that are added.

   A src.alt package may also contain whole new files. In fact, all will
   contain at least one, as the presence of a "README" file is enforced by
   makesrcalt. The new files will also be printed, if they are available.

   dumpsrcalt's command-line options control which parts of the src.alt are
   output. By default all information known about a src.alt is printed. This
   includes a summary with the name of the src.alt, the benchmark to which it
   applies, the versions of OMP2012 with which it may be used, and a count of
   new and changed files.

   Here are the contents of the src.alt created in the example for
   makesrcalt:

 $ dumpsrcalt 360.ilbdc.no_line.omp2012.v1.0.tar.xz
 This is src.alt "no_line" for 360.ilbdc.
 It is usable with version 1.0 of the benchmark.
 It contains 1 new file and changes to 1 existing file.

   Notice that the output from dumpsrcalt is suitable for use as input to
   many patch (1) programs, available on Unix systems and in some add-on
   packages for Windows (e.g. Cygwin). If you try to apply the output of
   dumpsrcalt yourself, take care to notice how paths are handled by your
   patch program, especially if the src.alt is for a benchmark that has a
   complicated source tree. Many patch programs will pay attention to the
   filename but not the path listed on the "Index:" lines, so it may be best
   to apply them using the "-p1" option, to cause patch to ignore "Index:"
   lines and use the full paths of the files as listed in the diff.

   dumpsrcalt's command-line options are intended to be self-explanatory:

 $ dumpsrcalt --help
 Usage: bin/dumpsrcalt [options] <benchmark> <srcaltname>
        bin/dumpsrcalt [options] <path to srcalt tarball>
        bin/dumpsrcalt [options] <path to srcalt.pm>
 Options:
    --skip-changed         -- Do not output diffs of files that have changed
    --skip-new             -- Do not output diffs for new files
    --summarize            -- Do not output any diffs at all
    --no-summary           -- Do not output the summary for the src.alt

 <benchmark> must be the full nnn.name form
 <srcaltname> must match the name of the subdirectory in the benchmark's
   src.alt directory

extract_config

   If you have a rawfile, you can extract the config file that was used with
   it. To do so, use the extract_config utility.

   For example, starting with a freshly-installed SPEC OMP2012 directory
   tree:

  % runspec --config=Example-simple --size=test --iterations=1 \
    --tuning=base --output_format=text,raw botsspar > /dev/null
  % cd result
  % ls
  OMPG2012.001.test.rsf OMPG2012.001.test.txt OMP2012.001.log       lock.OMP2012

   Note that we have just the single result. Let's make a temporary directory
   and copy the rawfile there:

  % mkdir tmp
  % cd tmp
  % cp ../OMPG2012.001.test.rsf .
  % ls
  OMPG2012.001.test.rsf

   (On Windows, that ls command would be spelt dir. You'll find some more
   Windows notes in the introduction.)

   Now, attempt to extract the config file:

  % extract_config --stdout OMPG2012.001.test.rsf > tmp.cfg

   Does the extracted file match the original?

  % diff -u ../../config/try_utilities.cfg tmp.cfg

  %

   Yes. The only differences are:

     * The copy in the rawfile adds a comment to tell you how the config file
       was invoked.
     * The original copy (in $SPEC/config) has the MD5 information for
       359.botsspar. (The config file is tucked away into the rawfile without
       the MD5 section.)

   The config file can also be extracted directly to a file:

  % extract_config --nostdout OMPG2012.001.test.rsf
 Wrote "OMPG2012.001.test.cfg"

   or

  % extract_config OMPG2012.001.test.rsf
 Wrote "OMPG2012.001.test.cfg"

   Lastly, you can choose the filename if you're piping files in via stdin:

  % extract_config --basename=SampleFilename < OMPG2012.001.test.rsf
 Wrote "SampleFilename.cfg"

    On Windows systems

   Instead of saying diff just above, you would say fc (and, as already
   mentioned, dir is the Windows spelling for what Unix calls ls.)

extract_flags

   If you have a rawfile, you can extract the XML flags description file that
   the result uses. To do so, use extract_flags. Usage is similar to
   extract_raw, but unlike extract_raw, the extract_flags utility might not
   produce a flags description file identical to the original flags file.
   This is because EOLs (end-of-line) characters are normalized to Unix-style
   LF (line feed) only.

   Note: If you have used a flags description file to format your result, the
   entire flags file is stored in the raw file (not just the part needed for
   result).

   For example, continuing the example from extract_raw, you can extract the
   flags file using the following command:

 $ extract_flags --stdout new.rsf > extracted.flags.xml
 $ diff ../myflags.xml ./extracted.flags.xml
 $

   We see no difference between the extracted flags description file and the
   original. Notice that the above command asked for the flags to be written
   to standard out; without that switch, they would have been written to
   whatever filename was suggested.

   If you'd like for the filename of the extracted flags file to match the
   rawfile, use the --nofilename option. This will cause extract_flags to
   ignore the flag file's "suggested filename":

     % ls *rsf
     omp2012-20060901-00074.rsf  omp2012-20060904-00080.rsf
     omp2012-20060901-00075.rsf  omp2012-20060904-00081.rsf
     omp2012-20060903-00076.rsf  omp2012-20060904-00082.rsf
     omp2012-20060903-00077.rsf  omp2012-20060904-00083.rsf
     omp2012-20060904-00078.rsf  omp2012-20060904-00084.rsf
     omp2012-20060904-00079.rsf  omp2012-20060904-00085.rsf
     % extract_flags --nofilename omp2012-20060904-00085.rsf
     Reading "omp2012-20060904-00085.rsf"
     Wrote "omp2012-20060904-00085.xml"
     %

   (History: as of SPEC OMP2012 V1.1) You can format a result with multiple
   flags files. If you used multiple flags files as input to runspec then you
   will get multiple flags files when running extract_flags.


 # extract_flags OMPG2012.001.ref.rsf
 Reading "OMPG2012.001.ref.rsf"
 Wrote "platform-setup.xml"
 Wrote "pathscale-flags.xml"

 # extract_flags --nofilename OMPG2012.001.ref.rsf
 Reading "OMPG2012.001.ref.rsf"
 Wrote "OMPG2012.001.ref.xml"
 Wrote "OMPG2012.001.ref-1.xml"

   In the examples above, result 001 used two flags files. One has
   information about the platform (which might contain items such as BIOS
   settings), and the other describes the compiler.

   Note: If a raw file has not been formatted with a flags description file,
   extract_flags does nothing.

extract_raw

   If you have a PDF, HTML, or PostScript output file, you can extract the
   rawfile that was used to generate it. To do so, use extract_raw. For
   example:

 $ cp -p OMPG2012.267.ref.rsf new
 $ ls -g new
 -rw-rw-r--   1 ptg       186202 Mar 13 22:57 new
 $ rawformat -o html,raw --flagsurl ./myflags.xml new 2>&1 > /dev/null
 $ ls -g new.html new.rsf
 -rw-rw-r--   1 ptg       109390 Mar 20 12:48 new.html
 -rw-rw-r--   1 ptg       194193 Mar 20 12:48 new.rsf
 $ mkdir AppleFrancisco
 $ cd AppleFrancisco/
 $ cp ../new.html .
 $ ls -g
 -rw-rw-r--   1 ptg       109390 Mar 20 12:51 new.html
 $ extract_raw new.html
 new.html: Wrote "new.rsf"

 $ diff ../new.rsf new.rsf
 $

   In the above example, we begin by copying the original rawfile (always
   recommended anytime you use commands that create new rawfiles). The
   rawformat command takes new as input and produces as output both new.html
   and new.rsf. We copy only new.html to a newly created directory, where we
   demonstrate that extract_raw can create a copy of new.rsf that is
   identical to the copy in the parent directory.

    On Windows systems

   Note that the file you extract from can be PDF, PostScript, or HTML, just
   as on Unix systems, with one important exception: if you are using a
   browser that attempts to add value to the HTML when you save it, that
   browser may break the embedded rawfile. For example, with Internet
   Explorer Version 5.00.3103.1000, if you are viewing a SPEC OMP2012 html
   file and you select File -> Save As, the default for "Save as type" is
   shown as

      "Web Page, complete (*.htm,*.html)"

   Do not accept that default if you want to be able to retrieve the rawfile
   later on. If you take the default, your saved file will be incomplete. To
   save the web page INCLUDING the embedded rawfile, you must change "Save as
   type" to

      "Web Page, HTML only (*.htm,*.html)"

flag_dump

   (You can also invoke this utility with the spelling: 'flags_dump')

   If you have an XML flag description file, such as one extracted using
   extract_flags, or one downloaded from SPEC, flag_dump will create a more
   human-readable HTML version from it. The flag_dump utility will also
   handle more than one XML flag description at a time.

   For example:

 $ cd /tmp
 $ mkdir myflags
 $ cd myflags/
 $ cp $SPEC/Docs/flags/*xml .
 $ ls
 example-medium-cfg-flags.xml    flags-advanced.xml              flags-simple.xml
 $ cp flags-advanced.xml flags-for-willi.xml
 $ flag_dump flags-advanced.xml flags-for-willi.xml flags-simple.xml
 Processing flags-advanced.xml...wrote flags-advanced.html
 Processing flags-for-willi.xml...wrote flags-for-willi.html
 Processing flags-simple.xml...wrote flags-simple.html
 $

   If you are writing a flags file, you should validate that the dump is
   valid HTML. If it isn't, you probably made a mistake in the HTML text that
   you have included inside your XML flags file. A handy HTML validator can
   be found at http://validator.w3.org/.

   Note that flag_dump utility assumes that you are formatting flags files
   written by users. These files are not allowed to contain mandatory flags.
   If you attempt to use the flag_dump utility to format any of the
   suite-provided flag files such as flags_mandatory.xml or the benchmark
   flag files that reside in $SPEC/benchspec/OMP2012/*/Spec/ directory, the
   utility will exit with an error message such as the one below.

     % cd $SPEC/benchspec
     % flag_dump flags_mandatory.xml
     Processing flags_mandatory.xml...
     ERROR: The flag file at
            flags_mandatory.xml
          contains one or more flags in the class "mandatory", which is not
          allowed.

go (Unix only)

   When you source the shrc, as described in runspec.html, the 'go' shell
   alias is created. go is a handy utility to navigate the directory
   structure of a SPEC source tree. Here are the various things it
   understands and the places they will take you:

 If you say          You'll end up in
         go          $SPEC
       go top
       go bin        $SPEC/bin (where the tools live)
      go config      $SPEC/config
      go result      $SPEC/result
     go results
       go doc        $SPEC/Docs
       go docs
       go cpu        $SPEC/benchspec/OMP2012
    go benchmark     The top level directory for the named benchmark, if it can
                     be found. (Examples follow)
       go 350        $SPEC/benchspec/OMP2012/350.md
                     $SPEC/benchspec/OMP2012/351.bwaves Notice that abbreviated
                     names are accepted. But if the abbreviation is ambiguous,
                     the command will pick the first match, so pay attention to
                     the reply:
      go bwaves
                     $ go g
                     /spec/omp2012/kit91/benchspec/OMP2012/351.bwaves
                     $ go bt
                     /spec/omp2012/kit91/benchspec/OMP2012/357.bt331
                     $
       go nada       no change: there's no benchmark named nada*
                     The named subdirectory of the directory tree for the
 go benchmark subdir referenced benchmark, for example "go swim run". You can
                     also name more than one level of subdirectory: "go 372 data
                     train".
                     If you are already in a benchmark subtree, then you can
                     move to a different branch of the same benchmark, by naming
                     the branch and not mentioning a benchmark. For example:

      go subdir      $ pwd
                     /rahul/benchspec/OMP2012/367.imagick/run/build_base_a3.0000
                     $ go exe
                     /rahul/benchspec/OMP2012/367.imagick/exe
                     $

   go also understands -h and --help, and will output a short usage message
   in response to either of those arguments.

   Note: If you leave the shell where you sourced shrc, the alias is no
   longer available! So if you want to use this alias, do not start a
   sub-shell.

   Note: 'go' does not know about your settings for output_root or expid, and
   will not be able to take you to your run, exe, or result directories if
   you use those features. See ogo for something that can help.

    Users of shells compatible with csh

   (History: since the release of SPEC OMP2012 V1.0,) If you use a csh-like
   shell, please note that after you say source cshrc, there is a go alias
   that is set up for you, which implements the same features as described
   above.

    Windows Users

   Sorry, the go feature does not exist for Windows systems.

index (UNSUPPORTED)

   As you are preparing sets of results, you might find it handy to use
   scripts.misc/index. This script is NOT supported - please do not submit
   bug reports for it. But you're welcome to try it out, like so:

 $ ls
 omp16rate.rsf          omp32rate.rsf
 $ rawformat -o html *rsf > /dev/null
 $ ls
 omp16rate.flags.html   omp16rate.rsf          omp32rate.html
 omp16rate.gif          omp32rate.flags.html   omp32rate.rsf
 omp16rate.html         omp32rate.gif
 $ $SPEC/bin/scripts.misc/index
 $ ls
 omp16rate.flags.html   omp16rate.rsf          omp32rate.gif
 omp16rate.gif          index.html             omp32rate.html
 omp16rate.html         omp32rate.flags.html   omp32rate.rsf
 $

   In the above example, we have a couple rawfiles in a directory, generate
   html reports for them, and then add an index.

makesrcalt

   SPEC distributes approved source changes in packages referred to as
   src.alts, which are applied using the config file src.alt option. (The
   file config.html also has an example showing what happens when one is
   applied.)

   A src.alt is a specialized difference file, and can't be made by hand.
   When you need to package some source changes, makesrcalt is the tool you
   need.

   If you are a developer and you believe that changes are needed to the SPEC
   source code, it will probably be convenient to work in a sandbox,
   temporarily abandoning the tools during your development phase. (Or, you
   can use convert_to_development to make the whole installation into one big
   sandbox.) Once you have a pretty good idea of the changes that you want:

    1. Create a subdirectory under the benchmark's src/ directory named
       "src.alt/".

    2. Decide on a name for your src.alt. The src.alt name may contain only
       letters, digits, and underscores. For convenience, it should be short.
       Create a subdirectory under src/src.alt/ using the name you have
       chosen.

    3. In that subdirectory, deposit any modified or new source files for the
       benchmark.

    4. You must also put a file named "README" in that subdirectory. Its
       contents are up to you; to see examples of the kind of information
       that is usually placed in README files, see
       www.spec.org/omp2012/src.alt. In your draft, kindly do NOT claim that
       it is approved; the release manager will do that at the last minute.

    5. Once the directory structure is set up, creation of the src.alt
       package is simple: just type makesrcalt followed by the name of the
       benchmark and the src.alt name.

    6. Contact SPEC to get the src.alt approved.

   Example: We've made source changes to 360.ilbdc to remove preprocessor
   #line directives from the mod_relax.F90 source file. This src.alt will be
   called 'no_line':

 $ makesrcalt 360.ilbdc no_line

 Making 'no_line' src.alt for 360.ilbdc
 This will be usable with version 1.0 of the suite.

 Finished making 'no_line' src.alt for 360.ilbdc.  Elapsed time: 0 seconds
 $

   If you use --help, you'll get an up-to-date list of options. Usually, you
   won't need any of these:

 $ makesrcalt --help
 Usage: bin/makesrcalt [options] <benchmark> <srcaltname>
 Options:
    --usewith <min>:<max>  -- Set the versions of the suite that will accept
                              this src.alt (defaults to 1.1)
    --notarball            -- Skip packaging the src.alt as a tarball (created
                              by default)
    --context <lines>      -- Set lines of context for the diff.  This defaults
                              to 3 and should not be changed.
    --help                 -- Print this message

 <benchmark> must be the full nnn.name form
 <srcaltname> must match the name of the subdirectory in the benchmark's
   src.alt directory
 $

   (History: the makesrcalt utility was improved in, and was documented for
   the first time with, SPEC OMP2012 V1.1.)

ogo (Unix only)

   When you source shrc, as described in runspec.html, the 'ogo' shell alias
   is created. Its function is similar to the go alias with one important
   difference: if you use the output_root setting in your config file (also
   discussed in runspec.html) you can use ogo as a shorthand for moving
   around both the original installed benchmark tree and your output tree.

   To do so, simply set the GO environment variable to the same value as your
   output_root. Then, 'ogo' will use the contents of that variable as the top
   level of the benchmark tree when looking for run directories and results.

   For example, you could say something like this:

 $ go config
 /spec/config
 $ grep output_root cds.cfg
 output_root = /cds_stuff
 $ GO=/cds_stuff
 $ ogo run perl
 Using value in GO for output_root: /cds_stuff
 /cds_stuff/benchspec/OMP2012/363.swim/run
 $

   Note the helpful message that tells you which directory you have landed
   in. (If you define the environment variable OGO_NO_WARN the message will
   be shorter - the first line "Using value in GO..." will not be output.)

   In this example, the benchmarks are installed in "/spec", and output_root
   is set to "/cds_stuff" in the config file. Any runs using that config file
   will write their results, executables, and run directories under
   "/cds_stuff". Continuing with other examples:

   If you say  You'll end up in
       ogo     /cds_stuff
     ogo top   Your own private output tree
   ogo result  /cds_stuff/result
               Your own private result directory
   ogo 363 run /cds_stuff/benchspec/OMP2012/363.swim/run
               Your own private run directories
   ogo nab exe /cds_stuff/benchspec/OMP2012/352.nab/exe
               Your own private executables
               /spec/Docs
     ogo doc   There's only one Docs directory, on the original installed
               $SPEC tree
               /spec/config
   ogo config  The config directory is always on the original installed tree;
               set its protections as described in runspec.html
               /spec/benchspec/OMP2012/351.bwaves/src
   ogo 351 src Run directories are under output_root, but the benchmark src
               directory is still in the original installed $SPEC tree.

   ogo also understands -h and --help, and will output a short usage message
   in response to either of those arguments.

   Saying ogo top or just ogo takes you to $GO. It used to take you to $SPEC.

   Note: It's not necessary to export the "GO" variable. Declaring this
   variable at the command-prompt is sufficient.

     $ GO=/tmp/cds
     $ echo $GO
     /tmp/cds

    Users of shells compatible with csh

   ogo has also been implemented for cshrc. There is one restriction: to get
   the full feature set above, you must set OGO to the actual directory, not
   to a symbolic link.

    Windows Users

   Sorry, the ogo feature does not exist for Windows systems.

port_progress

   The port_progress utility analyzes log files and summarizes errors. It was
   primarily used during the benchmark porting phase for SPEC OMP2012, but
   can still come in handy, for example when trying the benchmarks with a new
   compiler. To use it:

   cd $SPEC/result  (or on Windows, cd %SPEC%\result)
   port_progress logfile...

   Optionally, you can limit output by saying:

   -c config    only report logs that match the named config file

   In the example below:

     * User john has asked for a summary of logs that used config files that
       match "dec2".
     * Te, Tr, and Ref indicate the Test, Train, and Ref workloads.
     * In the first line of the table, the benchmark 350.md is reported as
       successful ("S") for all 6 tests (base tuning/peak tuning,
       test/train/ref).
     * A line down, 351.bwaves succeeded for the test workload with base
       tuning, but no information is available about the other 5 tests. The
       code "b?" indicates that there was at least one build attempt for a
       benchmark, but it was not recorded as Successful, nor was it recorded
       as having a run-time error.
     * The next line, 352.nab, is blank because that benchmark was not
       attempted at all with config file dec22a.cfg.
     * Benchmark 367.imagick has a code "VE" for all workloads, indicating
       validation errors. Additional information about that failure is at the
       bottom of the report (not shown below).

   --nopeak. This option may be convenient if, at a particular moment, you
   are only debugging one type of output.

printkids.pl

   Some benchmark executables are invoked multiple times. If you'd like to
   know how much time was spent on each invocation, it may not be easy to

printpath.pl

   As a convenience for Windows users, you can use printpath.pl to print your
   path in an easier to read form. You can send the output to a file, which
   can then be easily edited.

   In the example below, printpath.pl makes it easy to notice that cygwin (a
   Windows/Unix compatibility product) is in the path. SPEC recommends that
   your %PATH% should not include Windows/Unix compatibility products,
   because these have sometimes contributed to hard-to-diagnose errors.

rawformat

   "rawformat" is the result formatter. It can be invoked directly, by typing
   rawformat, or equivalently by typing runspec --rawformat. These two
   commands achieve the same effect because, saying runspec --rawformat just
   causes runspec to exit, invoking rawformat in its stead, and passing the
   formatter whatever other options you mentioned on the command line.

   The rawformat utility is also automatically invoked by runspec at the end
   of a run, to generate the reports from your run.

   For convenience, most rawformat options are documented in runspec.html,
   which see for basic information on using this command. You can also say
   rawformat --help to get a list of switches that are used by the formatter.

   Note that when runnng rawformat, you will always get format "Submission
   Check", which encourages consistent formatting for various result fields
   when preparing final (submittable) reports. In addition, you will get the
   formats that you mention on the command line, or, if none are mentioned
   there, then you will get the defaults documented under output_format.

   A few additional points are worth mentioning, in the following sections.

  Editing result description fields

   A result rawfile may be edited to update reader fields, such as the system
   description. Rawfile syntax is similar to the syntax in config files, with
   a few exceptions:

     * config files use equal signs; rawfiles use colons
     * the benchmark name is prepended to field names
     * rawfiles may not be edited beyond a certain point
     * rawfiles have stricter rules for field continuation
     * rawfiles allow two fields, sw_parallel_defeat and test_date, which are
       not allowed in config files

   These points are described in this section.

   WARNING: Before you do anything, make a backup copy of the rawfile first!

   Example: What do you do when Marketing decides to change the name from
   "SuperHero 4" to "SuperHero IV" just before you publish the results, or
   just before you're ready to submit them to SPEC? In your config file, you
   had

  hw_model = SuperHero 4

   which has caused the rawfile to contain the line

 spec.omp2012.hw_model: SuperHero 4

   and you've just been told that the name is wrong. You don't have time to
   re-run your test. It's too late to change the config file.

   SPEC does allow you to edit the rawfile to make corrections. Just make
   sure that you only edit the fields located before the "fence":

   # =============== do not edit below this point ===================


   WARNING: Make a backup copy of the rawfile first!

   For example:

 $ cd $SPEC/result
 $ cp OMPG2012.001.ref.rsf new.rsf
       edit new.rsf to make your changes
 $ diff OMPG2012.001.ref.rsf new.rsf

  About continuation fields in rawfiles

   Notice when editing fields that have more than one line that you need to
   construct the numbers with correct syntax. The syntax in the rawfile is a
   bit more picky than in config files (compare the following vs. the
   config.html section on "Field scoping and continuation". You cannot say
   something like this:

   WRONG: spec.omp2012.sw_compiler: Intel C Compiler 9.1 for Windows XP
          spec.omp2012.sw_compiler1: Visual Studio 2005 (for libraries)

   because the tools are not prepared at this point for a mixture of numbered
   and un-numbered fields. If you need to have continued fields, say instead:

   RIGHT: spec.omp2012.sw_compiler0: Intel C Compiler 9.1 for Windows XP
          spec.omp2012.sw_compiler1: Visual Studio 2005 (for libraries)

  Fields allowed only in rawfiles

   One testbed description field is allowed in raw files that is not allowed
   in config files:

             When the tests were run. This field is populated automatically
             based on the clock in the system under test. Setting this in the
   test_date config file will generate a warning and the setting will be
             ignored. If your system clock is incorrect, then the value may
             be edited in the raw file. It's better to avoid the necessity to
             edit, by setting your system clock properly.

    On Windows systems

   You may find that --output_format will only accept one argument at a time.
   If so, first create the rawfile with --output_format raw, then use the new
   rawfile to create the other reports.

relocate (Unix only)

   If you rearrange mount points or rename your SPEC root directory, you will
   probably find confusing problems like the one in the example that follows.
   We used to have a working SPEC tree under /omp2012/omp2012-kit91, but
   we're going to change that:

 $ cd /omp2012
 $ mv omp2012-kit91 jamesbond
 $ cd jamesbond
 $ . ./shrc
 $ runspec -h
 -bash: /omp2012/jamesbond/bin/runspec: /omp2012/omp2012-kit91/bin/specperl:
   bad interpreter: No such file or directory

   The problem is that the first line of runspec points to a path that no
   longer exists:

 $ head -1 bin/runspec
 #!/omp2012/omp2012-kit91/bin/specperl
 $

   Fortunately, SPEC has provided a tool to relocate the tools in the new
   tree:

 $ cd /omp2012/jamesbond
 $ . ./shrc
 $ relocate
 Top of SPEC benchmark tree is '/omp2012/jamesbond'
 $ runspec -h | head -3

 Using 'solaris10-sparc' tools
 Reading MANIFEST... 13574 files

   Limitations: There are some limitations to this tool. Most notably, it
   uses perl, so if the tree has been re-arranged in such a way that perl has
   an identity crisis and can't find itself, you'll be in trouble. Make sure
   that you have sourced shrc, as in the next example; if it still fails, you
   may need to reinstall the OMP2012 kit.

 $ cd /omp2012
 $ mv jamesbond dr_evil
 $ cd dr_evil
 $ bin/relocate
 Your $SPEC variable is not set correctly!

   Important: delete the old run and build directories. When setting up run
   directories, the tools read benchspec/OMP2012/nnn.benchmark/run/list to
   see what directories already exist. (A similar method is used for build
   directories.) If the list contains references to directories that are not
   underneath the current top, the intended behavior is that such directories
   should cause a warning, and should not be used. For example:

   Notice: Unusable path detected in run directory list file.
       /brian/liberator/omp2012/benchspec/OMP2012/350.md/run/list
   references one or more paths which will be ignored, because they are
   not subdirectories of this run directory.  This condition may be a
   result of having moved your SPEC benchmark tree.  If that's what happened,
   and if you don't need the old run directories, you can just remove
   them, along with the list file.  (Usually it's safe to delete old
   run directories, as they are automatically re-created when needed.)


   Unfortunately, it is sometimes possible to confuse the tools when the list
   contains directories that are not underneath $SPEC. Although the above
   message is printed, the tools can actually end up using a mixture of old
   and new directory paths, and nothing good can come of such mixtures. To
   avoid the confusion, you should delete the old run directories right after
   the relocate. Old build directories should be deleted (perhaps after
   backing them up if you wish to save them for reference). For example:

   mkdir newdir
   mv $SPEC/* newdir
   cd newdir
   bin/relocate
   cd benchspec/OMP2012
   spectar cf - */build | specxz > ~/mybuilds.backup.tar.xz
   rm -Rf */run */build


specdiff

   In order to decide whether your system got the correct answer for a
   benchmark, runspec writes a file called compare.cmd in the run directory,
   and then calls specinvoke, which calls specdiff. (The specinvoke utility
   is described below.)

   Suppose that your results are flagged as incorrect, but you'd like to have
   more detail. You could ask for more than 10 lines of detail by changing
   the config file's default for difflines from 10 to something else, and
   re-running the experiment. But, you might save a lot of time and avoid the
   re-run of the experiment, by calling specdiff directly, with a different
   number of lines for its switch -l.

   For example, a file chock-full of wrong answers for 444.namd has been
   created by hand. First, let's see how specdiff would normally be run (line
   wraps added for readability):

 $ go nab run
 $ cd run_base_test_try_utilities.0000/
 $ specinvoke -c 1 -f compare.cmd -n
 # Use another -n on the command line to see chdir commands
 # Starting run for copy #0
 specperl /omp2012/dr_evil/bin/specdiff -m -l 10  --reltol 0.04 \
 /omp2012/dr_evil/benchspec/OMP2012/352.nab/data/test/output/1ea0.out 1ea0.out > 1ea0.out.cmp

   The above says that normally we test for correct answers by comparing the
   file $SPEC/benchspec/OMP2012/352.nab/data/test/output/1ea0.out versus the
   file 1ea0.out in the current directory. Normally, 10 lines of detail are
   printed. Let's change that to 15 lines, and compare versus our
   intentionally wrong file instead:

 $ specdiff -m -l 15  --reltol 0.04  \
      /omp2012/dr_evil/benchspec/OMP2012/352.nab/data/test/output/1ea0.out 1ea0_wrong.out

specinvoke

   In order to run a benchmark, runspec writes a series of commands in the
   run directory, in the file speccmds.cmd. These commands are then
   interpreted by specinvoke.

   When something goes wrong, it is often useful to try the commands by hand.
   Ask specinvoke what it did, by using the "-n" switch:

 $ go nab run
 /omp2012/dr_evil/benchspec/OMP2012/352.nab/run
 $ cd run_base_ref_try_utilities.0000
 $ ls
 1afs             1ea0.out.mis     control          speccmds.cmd
 1akd             aminos           gcn4             speccmds.err
 1ea0             compare.cmd      gcn4dna          speccmds.out
 1ea0.err         compare.err      gcn4p1           speccmds.stdout
 1ea0.out         compare.out      hkrdenq
 1ea0.out.cmp     compare.stdout   nabmd_base.12.3
 $ specinvoke -n
 # specinvoke r6392
 #  Invoked as: specinvoke -n
 # timer ticks over every 1000 ns
 # Use another -n on the command line to see chdir commands and env dump
 # Starting run for copy #0
 ../run_base_ref_try_utilities.0000/nabmd_base.12.3 1ea0 281910391 > 1ea0.out 2>> 1ea0.err
 $

   In the above example, we see how nab is invoked (line wraps added for
   readability). If you wanted to try out your own variations on the above
   command by hand, you could do so.

   Here are the switches supported by specinvoke:

 $ specinvoke -h
 Usage: specinvoke [options] [instructionfile]
            -i <n>          iterations
            -c <n>          concurrent processes (overrides -C in command file)
                               Do not attempt to use this flag for rate runs.
            -E              return non-zero exit code if child does
            -s shell        shell to invoke
            -f file         instruction file
            -o file         output file
            -e file         error file
            -d dir          change to dir first
            -n[n]           print a 'dry_run' of commands
            -A              return 0 error code
            -S msecs        sleep between spawning copies (in milliseconds)
            -r              don't do I/O redirection ($command already has it)
            -N              open null device when no input file is specified
            -Z              use zero-length file when no input file is specified
            -C              (default) close stdin when no input file is specified
            -D <n>          Turn on debugging at level <n>
            -q              Stop issuing commands as soon as one fails (default)
            -k              Continue issuing commands even if one fails
            -h              this message

   The -q and -k switches may be useful if specinvoke is being used
   separately as part of a benchmark development or debug effort (see
   runspec-avoidance.html.)

  specinvoke -nn prints (but does not set) the environment

   The output of specinvoke -nn is expanded. It now includes information
   about environment variables that were set by the tools prior to the
   invocation, which may come in very handy if you want to run a benchmark
   outside the SPEC harness, for example, during a debugging or tuning
   effort.

   Consider the following example, where OMP_NUM_THREADS is set prior to
   doing a (fake) invocation of runspec:

    $ cd $SPEC/config
    $ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1024
    $ cp Example-linux64-amd64-gcc43+.cfg jeff.cfg
    $ runspec --config=jeff --fake --loose --size=test bwaves > /dev/null
    $

    $ go bwaves run
    /home/jeff/omp2012/benchspec/OMP2012/351.bwaves/run
    $ cd run_base_test_gcc43-64bit.0000/
    $ grep OMP speccmds.cmd
    -E OMP_NUM_THREADS 1024
    $

    $ specinvoke -nn | grep OMP
    OMP_NUM_THREADS=1024
    export OMP_NUM_THREADS PATH REPLYTO SHELL SPEC SPECDB_PWD SPECPERLLIB SSH_ASKPASS
    $

   In the example above, an environment variable is set to request 1024
   threads, and the setting is recorded in speccmds.cmd. When specinvoke -nn
   is used, the setting is printed, along with an export command that would
   put the setting into the environment (along with various other variables
   that the tools noticed in the original environment).

   It is important to understand that specinvoke does not actually set any
   environment variables for you. Consider this simplified test case:

    $ cat tmp.cmd
    -E MY_IMPORTANT_ENV_SETTING enabled
    echo "important setting: '$MY_IMPORTANT_ENV_SETTING'"
    $ specinvoke tmp.cmd
    important setting: ''
    $

   In the example above, the echo command prints nothing for the environment
   variable, despite the presence of -E MY_IMPORTANT_ENV_SETTING enabled in
   the command file. So, one might ask, what good is the feature? Well, it's
   very useful, if you just redirect the output of specinvoke -nn to a file,
   as is commonly done:

    $ specinvoke -nn tmp.cmd > doit.sh
    $ sh doit.sh
    important setting: 'enabled'
    $

specmake

   To build a benchmark, runspec uses specmake, which is simply GNU make
   under a unique name to avoid possible conflicts with other versions of
   make on your system.

   If a benchmark build fails, one of the most massively useful things you
   can do is to ask specmake what it did, by using the "-n" switch, which
   means "dry run".

   For example, let's create a config file that is unlikely to work:

 $ go config
 $ cat > tmp.cfg
 ext = silly
 FC  = f66
 $

   and try it out:

 $ runspec --config=tmp --tuning=base --action=build bt331

 $

   Sure enough, it failed. Let's find the appropriate run directory where our
   silly build was attempted:

 $ go bt331 build
 /omp2012/dr_evil/benchspec/OMP2012/357.bt331/build
 $ ls
 build_base_silly.0000 list
 $ cd build_base_silly.0000

   And ask specmake just exactly what it generated:

 $ specmake -n
 f66 -c -o add.o                    add.f
 f66             tml.o                     -o leslie3d

   OK, let's enter the command by hand:

 $ f66 -c -o add.o                    add.f
 -bash: f66: command not found
 $

   A great convenience of the OMP2012 suite is the fact that you can now
   proceed to play with all the files in this run directory, to prototype
   different changes and try out ideas, without fear that you will break
   anything. As long as you confine your edits to (in this example)
   $SPEC/benchspec/OMP2012/357.bt331/build/build_base_silly.0000, you are in
   a private sandbox and will not harm the original sources.

   Here are the switches supported by specmake:

 $ specmake -h
 Usage: specmake [options] [target] ...
 Options:
   -b, -m                      Ignored for compatibility.

   --debug[=FLAGS]             Print various types of debugging information.
   -e, --environment-overrides

   -n, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon
                               Don't actually run any commands; just print them.

specrxp

   To check XML flags files, runspec uses specrxp, which is simply RXP under
   a unique name to ensure no possible conflicts with other versions of rxp
   on your system. RXP is a validating XML parser. If your flags file passes
   RXP's tests, that doesn't mean that the flags file makes sense, but it's a
   start.

   You don't have to know anything abour specrxp, as it is called
   automatically. But if you want to, you can call it directly, for example:

 specrxp -V -s myflags.xml

   The -V switch requests validation, and -s requests that all output be
   suppressed except error messages.

   A manpage for rxp is available.

   Once you have your flags file passing specrxp validation, you should do a
   flag_dump, and validate that the dump is valid HTML.

   If specrxp seems to hang:

   If specrxp seems to hang when you run it, it may because this line in your
   flags file requires internet access, but your system is behind a firewall:

    SYSTEM "http://www.spec.org/dtd/cpuflags2.dtd"

   To resolve the problem, copy the flags file to a system that does have
   access; or define proxy environment variable(s) to allow internet access
   for programs on your system; or *temporarily* change the line to point to
   a local copy, like so:

    SYSTEM "file:///Arques/Site/Lab/carol/omp2012/Docs/flags/cpuflags2.dtd" <-- temporary only!

   Warning: Be sure to change it back to the correct location prior to
   attempting to submit a result to SPEC, because SPEC probably does not have
   access to /Arques/Site/Lab/, and the submission handler will probably
   bounce your submission.

   If you get unexpected errors from specrxp:

   If you get unexpected messages such as:

    Warning: Start tag for undeclared element

   check that you have correctly set the dtd version.

spectar

   The utility spectar is simply GNU tar, built under a known set of
   circumstances at the same time as other tools in the SPEC toolset, and
   renamed to avoid conflicts with any other versions of the program on your
   path. GNU tar, unlike some other archiving programs, correctly handles
   very long path names.

specxz

   The utility specxz is XZ Utils, built under a known set of circumstances
   at the same time as other tools in the SPEC toolset, and renamed to avoid
   conflicts with any other versions of the program on your path.

   Commonly-used switches work analogously to those in other compression
   utilities, such as -d to decompress. For details, say specxz --help

   Warning: this idiom, commonly used on Unix systems, has been observed to
   fail on some tested Windows systems:

 specxz -dc mumble.tar.xz | spectar -xf -  <-- may fail on Windows

   If you see failures, break it into two commands.

 specxz -d mumble.tar.xz                   <-- an alternative
 spectar -xf mumble.tar

toolsver

   If you have a rawfile, you can get information about the binary toolset
   and the versions of all of the system-independent tools files. To do so,
   use the toolsver utility.

   For example, starting with a freshly-installed SPEC OMP2012 directory
   tree:

 % runspec --config=try_utilities --size=test --iterations=1 \
   --tuning=base --output_format=ps > /dev/null
 % cd $SPEC/result
 % ls
 OMPG2012.001.test.ps  OMPG2012.001.test.rsf OMP2012.001.log       lock.OMP2012

   Note that we have just the single result file. Now, attempt to extract the
   version information:

 % toolsver OMPG2012.001.test.rsf
 OMPG2012.001.test.rsf:
  Binary toolset used was 'solaris10-sparc'
