1. Introduction

   SPEC supplies various tools that are used to ensure consistent operation
   of benchmarks across a variety of platforms. In order to generate a valid
   result file which can be submitted to SPEC, you must use the SPEC supplied
   tools.

  1.a. What are the tools?

   The tools include (but are not limited to):

    specdiff  examines results to see if the correct answer was obtained
   specinvoke invokes benchmarks for OMP2012
              GNU make (Calling it "specmake" avoids possible conflicts with
              versions of make that may already be on your system. SPEC
    specmake  requires that published results use the versions of the tools
              that it supplies, so that if SPEC applies patches or extensions
              from time to time, all users run with a consistent tool set.
              Similar considerations apply to other tools in this list.)
     specxz   The xz compression program
   specmd5sum md5sum from GNU coreutils, with enhancements
    spectar   GNU tar
    specperl  Perl
   Various Perl modules such as Algorithm::Diff, GD, HTML::Parser, PDF::API2,
   URI, XML::SAX, etc.

   Many of these tools are based on the freely available programs of the same
   name.

   Note: In this document, "Unix" is used to describe Unix and all Unix-like
   systems such as Linux.

  1.b. Pre-compiled binaries

   You will find pre-compiled binaries for the tools in the directories:

   $SPEC/tools/bin/<archname>

   The term $SPEC designates the top directory where you installed the
   benchmark suite. (On a Windows system, it would be called %SPEC%.)

   The precompiled binaries will be automatically installed when you run
   install.sh (Unix) or install.bat (Windows).

  1.c. When to build the tools yourself

   Sometimes it may be necessary to rebuild the tools, for example if a
   change in an operating system renders a precompiled binary inoperable, or
   if you are the first person to add support for a new architecture.

   It is generally not possible to do cross-compilation of Perl, as Perl's
   build process involves running binaries generated during the build.
   Therefore, getting a toolset onto an embedded platform without a native
   compiler is most likely impossible.

   NOTICE: If you are adding support for a new architecture, and intend to
   submit results to SPEC, you must ask SPEC to review your tool build.
   Please turn on your operating system's session recorder (e.g. in Unix,
   typically the script command) prior to doing buildtools. In Windows, you
   might have to do repetitious tedious repeated cut/paste clicking and
   clicking (so make that command window as big as possible). Also, you will
   be expected to provide the output from runspec -V and runspec --test on a
   system OTHER than the build system, where you have installed your new
   tools build.

2. How to build the tools

   If the directory $SPEC/tools/src (Unix) or %SPEC%\tools\src (Windows) does
   not yet exist, use xz and tar to expand install_archives/omp2012.tar.xz
   into a writable directly local to the build system. (Building tools on
   networked filesystems can work, but it's more likely to make some of GNU
   tar's tests fail, so it's safer to build on a local filesystem.)

   xz -dc install_archives/omp2012.tar.xz | tar -xf - tools/src

   The scripts $SPEC/tools/src/buildtools (Unix) or
   %SPEC%\tools\src\buildtools.bat (Windows) will build the tools. But you
   may need to invoke the buildtools script with appropriate environment
   variables set first - see the sections immediately following that provide
   notes about specific platforms.

   You will need a C99 compiler. Most of the tools are C++ or C89, but XZ is
   C99.

   If everything goes right, you won't have to do very much at all, other
   than watch build commands fly by.

  2.a. Notes specific to Unix systems

   When building the tools under Unix, the following warnings appear to be
   harmless as of May 2012:

     * Any message generated by a "make clean", especially the first time
       that you build, since there's nothing to clean!
     * Warnings about missing 'makeinfo', 'alocal', 'automake', 'autoconf'.

   You may find the following flags useful on the listed systems:

     * AIX (32-bit):
       CC=xlc CFLAGS='-O -qarch=ppc -D_LARGE_FILES -D_ILS_MACROS'
       PERLFLAGS="-Doptimize='-O' -Accflags='-D_LARGE_FILES'" OBJECT_MODE=32
       ./buildtools

     * AIX (64-bit):
       CC=xlc CFLAGS='-O3 -qarch=ppc64 -q64 -D_ILS_MACROS'
       PERLFLAGS="-Doptimize='-O' -Aoptimize='-qarch=ppc64 -q64'"
       OBJECT_MODE=64 ./buildtools

     * HPUX:
       CC="/opt/ansic/bin/cc" CFLAGS="-Ae +O2 +z -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
       -AC99" XZCFLAGS=-AC99 PERLFLAGS="-Doptimize=+O1
       -Dlibpth=/usr/lib/hpux32 -Dldflags=-lm -Dcppstdin=cc -Acppstdin=-E
       -Acppstdin=-Aa -Acppstdin=-D__STDC_EXT__ -Acppstdin=-AC89"
       ./buildtools

     * IRIX:
       ulimit -s 128000; CFLAGS="-c99 -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64" MD5CFLAGS="-O2"
       PERLFLAGS="-Doptimize=-O3 -Uloclib -Dlibpth=/usr/lib32"
       XZFLAGS="--disable-assembler --disable-shared" XZCFLAGS="-O1"
       ./buildtools

   Check out those who have gone before. If the system for which you're
   attempting to build tools is similar to one for which a tools build
   exists, you may gain insight by looking at the top of the build logs in
   tools/src/buildtools.log. Even if your system is very unusual and very
   different than previous systems, it is probably still worth your while to
   look over the previous logs. You don't have to read all 20,000 lines; just
   check out the environment variables and path settings and so forth from
   the top of previous builds.

  2.b. Notes specific to Windows systems

   Because XZ is written in C99, no version of Visual Studio (as of May 2012)
   can be used to build the tools. Instead, the Windows version of buildtools
   is designed to use the MinGW GCC compiler. It has been tested successfully
   with both 4.3 and 4.5 versions of GCC; the latest version available should
   be used. The tools are not yet ported to be built with a 64-bit compiler;
   use the 32-bit tools instead.

   The builds use makefiles to be processed with either mingw-make.exe (which
   is GNU make) or dmake.exe (which is built in the process of building
   tools). The full MSYS environment is not used, so all of the makefiles are
   pre-generated; the GNU autoconf system is not used. Compiler flags are
   defined in those pre-generated makefiles.
   Building tools under Cygwin is not supported and probably won't work.

   If it is necessary to unzip and untar the sources of the tools in Windows,
   open a Command-Prompt window, cd to %SPEC% (i.e. the top directory of
   SPEC). Then execute:

   cd tools
   bin\windows-i386\specxz.exe -d install_archives/omp2012.tar.xz
   ooo\windows-i386\spectar.exe -xvf install_archives/omp2012.tar

   Then go ahead and execute

   %SPEC%\tools\src\buildtools.bat

   You can ignore warnings about objects that are not found, especially at
   the beginning of each tool build, when cleanup is attempted from previous
   builds. Some tools may not know how to make 'clean', 'distclean', or
   'realclean'; don't worry about it.

   In Windows XP with Service Pack 2 or later, there may be a Security Alert,
   depending on the Firewall settings. "Windows Firewall has blocked this
   program from accepting connections from the Internet or a network." You
   may ignore this warning.

   All compiler warnings seen as of May 2012 appear to be harmless.

3. How to verify that your build succeeded

   After a tool build, you should:

   cd $SPEC (Unix) or %SPEC% (Windows)

   shrc.bat (Windows)
   . ./shrc (Unix, if you are in an sh-compatible shell.
                   If not, start one!)

   See if you can at least get as far as asking the major tools
   to identify themselves:

        runspec -V

   Or you can ask individual tools about themselves:

        specmake -v
        specxz -h
        specperl -v
        specdiff -h
        runspec -h
        specinvoke -h


   Running runspec --test will run more comprehensive tests on specperl.

4. Describing your newly-built tools

   As a courtesy to others who might like to know which systems you intended
   your new tools to work on, and to describe the environment in which they
   were built, you may write a short description file. The contents of this
   file will be displayed when install.sh is run. Windows users only have one
   choice, and thus no description is printed. The file is
   $SPEC/tools/bin/<archname>/description. If that directory does not exist,
   you should create it. (If the directory does not exist, packagetools will
   create it, but in order for the description to be packaged, it must be
   present before packagetools is run.) See the "Packagetools" section below
   for guidance about picking "<archname>".

   The format is very simple; in order to avoid wrapping on an 80-column
   screen, the first line must be no longer than 50 characters. In order to
   line up properly, subsequent lines should begin with 30 spaces and be no
   longer than 80 columns total.

   For example, given $SPEC/tools/bin/turboblaster-m68k/description with the
   following contents

 For TurboBlaster v2.1+ systems running on M68010
                              hardware.
                              Built on TurboBlaster v2.0 with GCC 1.81.

   A user using a TurboBlaster system when running install.sh would see in
   the list of toolset choices, something that looks approximately like

 turboblaster-m68k            For TurboBlaster v2.1+ systems running on M68010
                              hardware.
                              Built on TurboBlaster v2.0 with GCC 1.81.

   There are plenty of examples on the install media in
   tools/bin/*/description.

  4.a. Toolset presentation

   If the toolset you're building isn't the only one that will work on a
   particular system, you may want to adjust where in the list of toolsets it
   appears, or even whether it appears at all. By default toolsets are
   presented in lexical ASCII order. However, it is possible to both adjust
   the position of a toolset in the list of candidates, as well as keeping it
   from appearing at all.

   Let's assume that the TurboBlaster systems mentioned in the last section
   have migrated to PowerPC and have an emulation layer so that they can run
   old M68K binaries. Given two toolsets called turboblaster-m68k and
   turboblaster-ppc, normally the turboblaster-m68k would be presented and
   attempted first. And the emulation layer is so good that it would work,
   but it'd be slower than it needs to be.

    4.a.1. Excluding otherwise valid candidates

   There are several files that can be used to prevent install.sh from even
   attempting to use a toolset. The exclusion is silent, and for all intents
   and purposes makes the affected toolset behave just as one from another OS
   or architecture -- it doesn't even show up on the candidate list.

   To effect this exclusion, install.sh looks for signatures of the current
   system in files in each toolset's directory. A toolset is excluded from
   consideration if any of the following are true:

   Output from...          Appears in...
   uname -m       tools/bin/<archname>/excludearch
   uname -s       tools/bin/<archname>/excludearch
   uname -r       tools/bin/<archname>/excluderev
   uname -p       tools/bin/<archname>/excludeproc

   On a PPC-based TurboBlaster system, uname -m returns "PowerPC". Putting
   "PowerPC" into tools/bin/turboblaster-m68k/excludearch would ensure that
   TurboBlaster/PPC users never even saw the TurboBlaster/M68K tools.

   This is most useful for preventing cross-OS confusion. FreeBSD, for
   example, used to try to execute Solaris binaries. Putting "FreeBSD" (the
   output from uname -s on a FreeBSD system) into
   tools/bin/solaris-x86/excludearch fixed that problem and kept the
   unmaskable and alarming failure messages from appearing during
   installation.

    4.a.2. Affecting presentation order

   In the case where there may be two equally valid toolsets (as might be the
   case when there's a 32-bit and 64-bit build for the same OS), it's
   possible to change the order in which they're presented. Each toolset has
   a file named order in its directory. If it doesn't exist, packagetools
   will create this file with contents that are simply:

 1:<archname>

   (See the packagetools section for guidelines on picking <archname>.) The
   "priority" of a toolset decreases as that number increases. Continuing
   with the TurboBlaster example, if we wanted the PowerPC toolset to be
   preferred, we'd put

 2:turboblaster-m68k

   into tools/bin/turboblaster-m68k/order. That would ensure that
   turboblaster-ppc would appear first in the menu, as the number in its
   order file is "1". Since it appears first in the menu, it's installed
   before turboblaster-m68k.

5. Packagetools

   If everything has succeeded, and you intend to submit results using your
   new tools, you should submit the tools to SPEC. To do so:

      cd $SPEC (Unix) or cd %SPEC% (Windows)
      packagetools <archname>

   Pick an architecture name that other users will recognize. Check on the
   install media in tools/bin for some examples.

   The packagetools script will create:

     $SPEC/tools/bin/<archname>/specxz
     $SPEC/tools/bin/<archname>/spectar
     $SPEC/tools/bin/<archname>/specmd5sum
     $SPEC/tools/bin/<archname>/tools-<archname>.tar.xz

   Having created a large tarfile with everything in it, packagetools will
   then proceed to create an even larger tarfile with specxz and spectar it
   in too. This even bigger file is known as:

     $SPEC/<archname>-<version>.tar

   and is to be submitted to SPEC. (See also the example below.)

   You can optionally add components to your platform's toolset. For example,
   if you would like $SPEC/config/default.cfg to be set in an appropriate
   way, you can add the relative path to default.cfg as a parameter to
   packagetools:

 (on non-Windows systems)
      cd $SPEC
      packagetools <archname> config/default.cfg

   More than one file may be specified in this way.

   Operation on Windows is substantially similar; just provide the relative
   paths with backslashes instead of forward slashes.

   Please submit the resulting tarfile to SPEC for review, along with the
   recording of your tool build session. SPEC will review your tools, and
   assuming that they pass review, will add the tools you have built to its
   patch library, for possible distribution to future users of your
   interesting new architecture.

   NOTE 1: If your operating system is unable to execute the packagetools
   script, please have a look at what the script does and enter the
   corresponding commands by hand. Again, you will need to submit the results
   to SPEC.

   NOTE 2: Be sure to test your packaged tools on a different system,
   preferably one with a different disk layout. If the destination system is
   unable to invoke libperl.so, check that libperl.so exists in one of the
   locations where shrc expects to find it.

  5.a. Example: use packagetools

   Here is an example use of packagetools. In the example below, notice that:

     * At lines 1-3, we start by verifying that the correct environment has
       been set.
     * At line 7, a decription is provided for the toolset.
     * SPEC will want the log, and verification that runspec -V and runspec
       --test are working. At lines 11 to 13, these are created.
     * At line 15, the packagetools command is entered. Since SPEC will want
       the other three files, for convenience, they have been added to
       packagetools.
     * Note that basic sanity checking of a toolset also requires
       demonstration of runspec -V and runspec --test on a second system, as
       shown in the next section.

  5.b. Example: test the newly packaged tools

   Testing a newly-built toolset on the system where it was built is not
   enough to ensure basic sanity of the tools. Test for unintended
   dependencies by installing on an entirely different system. For example:

     * At line 1, below, it is assumed that a SPEC OMP tree exists on the
       destination system, and that it lacks a SPEC toolset.
     * Line 2 uses NFS (/net) to copy the new tar file from the build system.
       Use whatever method is convenient for you, such as scp or ftp,
       provided that you are sure that it does not damage the file.
     * Lines 3 and 4 bring over the recently built spectar and specmd5sum,
       which are used to verify that the copy worked correctly, and then to
       unpack the file.

6. Troubleshooting: What to do if something goes wrong

   If something goes wrong, unfortunately, you're probably just going to have
   to take it apart and figure out what. Here are some hints on how to go
   about doing that.

  6.a. Try it by hand

   If something goes wrong, you probably do NOT want to make some random
   adjustment (like: reinstall a compiler, fix an environment variable, or
   adjust your path) and start all over again. That's going to be painful and
   take a lot of your time. Instead, you should temporarily abandon the
   buildtools script at that point and just try to build the offending tool,
   until you understand exactly why that particular tool is failing.

   Consider turning on verbose diagnostics if your system has a way to do
   that. Make a huge terminal window (e.g. 200 columns wide by 84 lines tall,
   with 9999 lines recorded off the top), so you can see what is going on.

   Read what buildtools (or buildtools.bat) does for you, then cd to
   tools/src/<tool> and try the commands by hand. For example, you might do
   something like this:

     cd $SPEC/tools/src/<toolname>
     ./configure
     make (or build.sh or whatever you note buildtools would have done)

   Now, try fixing that environment variable or reinstalling that compiler,
   and rebuild the single tool. Does it look better?

   If not, have a close look at the error messages and the Makefile. Does the
   Makefile use a feature that is not present in your version of make? If so,
   can you get it to work with GNU make?

   Note that for GNU configure based tools (everything except Perl and its
   modules) you may specify your compiler by setting the CC environment
   variable. For compiler flags, set CFLAGS.

   When building perl, note that:

     * If you want to force the compiler use -Dcc=yourcompiler
     * If you want to force a compiler option use -Doptimize=youroption. If
       you have more than one option to use, do

        -Doptimize=-option1 -Aoptimize=-option2 -Aoptimize=option3 ...

   Many of the build logs in tools/src/buildtools.log have examples of
   settings used for PERLFLAGS.

   If you want to see more about what buildtools is doing for you, turn on
   your shell's verbose mode. For example:

    sh -x ./buildtools

  6.b. Known problems

   Try doing a web search to see if there are known problems with the tool on
   your architecture.

   If SPEC supplies Version X.Y of a tool and it just won't build on your
   operating system, you might check whether there is a new Version X.Y+1
   available. If so, download the new version to a scratch directory outside
   of the SPEC tree and try building it there. If that version succeeds, try
   to deduce why. Narrow it down to a one-line fix, won't you please? Then
   tell SPEC that you'd like the same one-line fix applied to its variant of
   the tool. Or, if you just can't narrow the fix down, ask SPEC whether it
   will approve use of Version X.Y+1 instead of X.Y on your system.

  6.c. Executing just part of buildtools

   Once you believe that you understand how to fix the problem tool, and can
   build it by hand, see whether the buildtools script can build it. You can
   execute just a portion of buildtools by defining environment variables.
   Please read the script itself to see what variables are allowed; the
   following are just some examples:

   SKIPALL      - turns off everything.  If you like, set this, then
                    turn individual phases on by setting them.
   DOTOOLSRM    - Remove previously installed tools
   DOCLEAN      - Run 'make clean', 'make distclean', and
                    'make realclean' in all source directories.
   DOMAKE       - build make
   DOXZ         - build xz
   DOTAR        - build tar
   DOMD5        - build specmd5sum
   DOSPECINVOKE - build specinvoke
   DORXP        - build rxp
   DOEXPAT      - build the expat XML parser, used by XML::SAX::ExpatXS
   DOPERL       - build perl
   DOPERL2      - build perl modules
   DOCOPY       - copy the results to $SPEC/bin and fix shbangs

   It doesn't matter what you set the environment variables to -- any
   non-zero-length string will do. In all cases, "DO" can be replaced with
   "SKIP" to reverse the sense of the setting.

   If you are using Windows, be sure to note the WARNING in buildtools.bat
   about how the variables work.

   If you can now build the (formerly misbehaving) tool using just part of
   buildtools, then you can try building the whole set (i.e. a build of all
   tools from start to finish). It should work now, so be sure to turn on
   your logging facility.
