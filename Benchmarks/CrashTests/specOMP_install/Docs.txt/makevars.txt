1. Introduction

   This document is intended for advanced users of the SPEC OMP2012 suite who
   want to understand more about how the benchmarks are built. Most users
   will not need this document. But if you are one of the select few who
   would like to understand the build process in detail, you should read the
   file:

   $SPEC/benchspec/Makefile.defaults (Unix) or
   %SPEC%\benchspec\Makefile.defaults (Microsoft Windows)

   and as you read it, you can refer to this document to help you interpret
   it.

   Note: from this point forward, readers who are using Microsoft Windows
   should please mentally reverse the slashes, and pretend that they saw
   "%SPEC%" where this document says "$SPEC".

   The settings used during the build process are taken from three sources:

    1. The benchmark's settings. For SPEC, these are found only in
       $SPEC/benchspec/OMP2012/<benchmark>/Spec/object.pm.

    2. A file called Makefile.spec, which is generated for this particular
       build from the tester's config file. It is found in
       $SPEC/benchspec/OMP2012/<benchmark>/run/build_<tune>_<extension>.nnnn/Makefile.spec

    3. The overall Makefile.defaults.

   The list above is in order from highest to lowest priority. That is, if a
   setting for a particular variable exists in object.pm, it cannot be
   overridden. Variables not specified in object.pm can be set by the user in
   Makefile.spec. If a setting is needed, and does not appear in either of
   those two places, a reasonable default is provided by Makefile.defaults.

   In practice, very few variables that affect the build are set in
   object.pm; it's more a repository of information about how to run and what
   settings to use when doing verification.

2. Items used in Makefile.defaults

   The following table attempts to take all the items in Makefile.defaults,
   classify them into one or more categories, and give a very brief
   explanation.

   Items found in Makefile.defaults are classified into these categories:

     config   = If you wish, you are free to set this in your config file.
     bench    = The benchmark sets it in Spec/object.pm.  Do not attempt to touch.
     tools    = Something computed by SPEC tools.  Really do not touch.
