	function - Allows macros to run Perl functions

This is a filepp module which allows macros to call Perl functions.

The module adds the keywords:
#function macro function
which tells filepp to call "function" when it finds "macro(args)" in a file

Wherever macro(args) is found in the file being processed, it will
call function(args) and replace macro(args) with the value returned by
function(args).

#rmfunction macro
which tells filepp to remove "macro" and its associated "function"

There is a simple test file included with this module.  To test the
function module use the following command (the filed "test" and
"test.pm" are in this directory):

filepp -m function.pm -m test.pm test.in

For full documentation on how to use filepp and the function module read
the filepp man page.
