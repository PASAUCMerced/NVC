<h4 id="intro">Introduction </h4>

<p class="l1">This document provides background information about the SPEC OMP2012 benchmark suite.  SPEC hopes that this
material will help you understand what the benchmark suite can, and cannot, provide; and that it will help you make efficient
use of the product.</p>

<p class="l1">Overall, SPEC designed SPEC OMP2012 to provide a comparative measure of compute intensive performance across
the widest practical range of hardware.  The product consists of source code benchmarks that are developed from real user
applications.  These benchmarks depend on the processor, memory and compiler on the tested system.</p>

<p class="l1">This document is organized as a series of questions and answers.</p>

<h4 id="Q1">Q1. What is SPEC?</h4>

   <p class="l1">SPEC is the <span class="newterm">S</span>tandard <span 
   class="newterm">P</span>erformance <span class="newterm">E</span>valuation
   <span class="newterm">C</span>orporation.  SPEC is a non-profit 
   organization whose members include computer hardware vendors, software
   companies, universities, research organizations, systems integrators, publishers and consultants.  SPEC's goal is to
   establish, maintain and endorse a standardized set of relevant benchmarks for computer systems.  Although no one set of
   tests can fully characterize overall system performance, SPEC believes that the user community benefits from objective
   tests which can serve as a common reference point.</p>


<h4 id="Q2">Q2. What is a benchmark?</h4>

   <p class="l1"> A <span class="newterm">benchmark</span> is "a standard of measurement or evaluation"
   (Webster&rsquo;s II Dictionary).  A computer benchmark is typically a computer program that performs a strictly defined
   set of operations - a <span class="newterm">workload</span> - and returns some form of result - a <span
   class="newterm">metric</span> - describing how the tested computer performed.  Computer benchmark metrics usually measure
   <span class="newterm">speed</span>: how fast was the workload completed; or <span class="newterm">throughput</span>: how
   many workload units per unit time were completed.  Running the same computer benchmark on multiple computers allows a
   comparison to be made.</p>


<h4 id="Q3">Q3. Should I benchmark my own application?</h4>

   <p class="l1">Ideally, the best comparison test for systems would be your own application with your own workload.
   Unfortunately, it is often impractical to get a wide base of reliable, repeatable and comparable measurements for
   different systems using your own application with your own workload.  Problems might include generation of a good test
   case, confidentiality concerns, difficulty ensuring comparable conditions, time, money, or other constraints.  </p>

<h4 id="Q4">Q4. If not my own application, then what?</h4>

   <p class="l1">You may wish to consider using standardized benchmarks as a reference point.  Ideally, a standardized
   benchmark will be portable, and may already have been run on the platforms that you are interested in.  However,  before
   you consider the results you need to be sure that you understand the correlation between your application/computing needs
   and what the benchmark is measuring.  Are the benchmarks similar to the kinds of applications you run?  Do the workloads
   have similar characteristics?  Based on your answers to these questions, you can begin to see how the benchmark may
   approximate your reality. </p>

   <p class="l1">Note: A standardized benchmark can serve as reference point.  Nevertheless, when you are doing vendor or
   product selection, SPEC does not claim that any standardized benchmark can replace benchmarking your own actual
   application.</p>


<h4 id="Q5">Q5. What does SPEC OMP2012 measure?</h4>

   <p class="l1">SPEC OMP2012 focuses on compute intensive performance, which means these benchmarks emphasize the
   performance of:</p>

    <ul class="l1">
       <li> the computer processor (CPU), </li>
       <li> the memory architecture, </li>
       <li> the parallel support libraries, and </li>
       <li> the compilers. </li>
    </ul>

   <p class="l1">It is important to remember the contribution of the latter three components.  SPEC OMP performance
   intentionally depends on more than just the processor.</p>

   <p class="l1">SPEC OMP2012 contains a suite that focuses on parallel 
computing performance using the OpenMP parallelism standard.</p>

   <p class="l1">The suite can be used to measure along the following vector:</p>

    <ul class="l1">
      <li><p><b>Compilation method:</b> Consistent compiler options across all programs of a given language (the base
      metrics) and, optionally, compiler options tuned to each program (the peak metrics).  See <a href="#Q14">Q14</a>,
      below, for more information.</p></li>
    </ul>

   <p class="l1">SPEC OMP2012 is not intended to stress other computer components such as networking, the operating system,
   graphics, or the I/O system.  
   Note that there are <a class="external"
   href="http://www.spec.org/benchmarks.html">many other SPEC benchmarks</a>, including benchmarks that specifically focus on
   graphics, distributed Java computing, webservers, and network file systems.</p> 


<h4 id="Q6">Q6. Why use SPEC OMP2012?</h4>

   <p class="l1">SPEC OMP2012 provides a comparative measure of parallel performance using OpenMP.
   If this matches with the type of workloads you are interested in, SPEC OMP2012 provides a good reference point.</p>

   <p class="l1">Other advantages to using SPEC OMP2012 include:</p>

    <ul class="l1">
      <li> The benchmark programs are developed from actual end-user applications, as opposed to being synthetic
      benchmarks.</li>
      <li> Multiple vendors use the suite and support it.</li>
      <li> SPEC OMP2012 is highly portable.</li>
      <li> A wide range of results are available at <a class="external" href="http://www.spec.org/">http://www.spec.org</a></li> 
      <li> The benchmarks are required to be run and reported according to a set of rules to ensure comparability and
      repeatability.</li>
    </ul>


<h4 id="Q7">Q7. What are the limitations of SPEC OMP2012?</h4>

   <p class="l1">As <a href="#Q3">described above</a>, the ideal benchmark for vendor or product selection would be your own
   workload on your own application.  Please bear in mind that no standardized benchmark can provide a perfect model of the
   realities of your particular system and user community.</p>


<h4 id="Q8">Q8. What is included in the SPEC OMP2012 package?</h4>

   <p class="l1">SPEC provides the following on the SPEC OMP2012 image:</p>

    <ul class="l1">
      <li> Source code for the OMPG2012 benchmarks</li>
      <li> A tool set for compiling, running, validating and reporting on the benchmarks </li>
      <li> Pre-compiled tools for a variety of operating systems</li>
      <li> Source code for the SPEC OMP2012 tools, for systems not covered by the pre-compiled tools</li>
      <li> Run and reporting rules defining how the benchmarks should be used to produce SPEC OMP2012 results.</li>
      <li> Documentation</li>
    </ul>


<h4 id="Q9">Q9. What does the user of the SPEC OMP2012 suite have to provide?</h4>

   <p class="l1">Briefly, you need a Unix, Linux, Mac OS X,  or Microsoft Windows system with compilers; 8GB of free disk space;
   and a minimum of 32GB of free memory - although more may be required, as described in <a class="external"
   href="system-requirements.html">system-requirements.html</a></p> 


<h4 id="Q10">Q10. What are the basic steps in running the benchmarks?</h4>

   <p class="l1">Installation and use are covered in detail in the SPEC OMP2012 User Documentation.  The basic steps are:</p> 

     <ul class="l1">
        <li> Ensure that you meet the <a class="external" href="system-requirements.html">system requirements</a>.</li> 
        <li> Install SPEC OMP2012 from the image on <a class="external" href="install-guide-unix.html">Unix, Linux, Mac OS X</a> (Mac OS has not been tested, but may work), or
        <a class="external" href="install-guide-windows.html">Microsoft Windows</a> (Windows is not supported by may work). </li> 
        <li> Determine which metric you wish to run. </li>
        <li> Learn about <a class="external" href="runspec.html">runspec</a>, which is the primary SPEC-provided tool.</li> 
        <li> Locate a configuration file as a starting point.  Hints about where to find one are in <a class="external"
        href="runspec.html#about_config">runspec.html</a>.</li> 
        <li> Use <tt>runspec</tt> to build (compile) the benchmarks.</li>
        <li> If the above steps are successful, use <tt>runspec</tt> to run, validate, and create a report on the performance
        of the benchmarks. </li>
     </ul>

   <p class="l1">If you wish to generate results suitable for quoting in public, you will need to carefully study and adhere to
   the <a class="external" href="runrules.html">run rules</a>.</p> 


<h4 id="Q11">Q11. What source code is provided?  What exactly makes up these suites?</h4>

   <p class="l1">OMPG2012 is based on compute-intensive applications provided as source code.  OMPG2012 contains
   14 benchmarks: 8 use Fortran, 5 use C, and 1 use C++.  The benchmarks are:</p>

   <p class="l1">Descriptions of the benchmarks, with reference to papers, web sites, and so forth, can be found in the
   individual benchmark descriptions (click the links above).  Some of the benchmarks also provide additional details, such
   as documentation from the original program, in the nnn.benchmark/Docs directories in the SPEC benchmark tree. </p>

   <p class="l1">The numbers used as part of the benchmark names provide an identifier to help distinguish programs from one
   another.  </p> 

<h4 id="Q12">Q12. Some of the benchmark names sound familiar; are these comparable to other programs?</h4>

   <p class="l1">Many of the SPEC benchmarks have been derived from publicly available application programs.
   The individual benchmarks in this suite may be similar, but are NOT identical to benchmarks or programs
   with similar names which may be available from sources other than SPEC.   In particular, SPEC has 
   invested significant effort to improve portability and to minimize hardware dependencies, 
   to avoid unfairly favoring one hardware platform over another.  For this reason, the application programs in
   this distribution may perform differently from commercially available versions of the
   same application.  </p>

   <p class="l1">Therefore, it is not valid to compare SPEC OMP2012 benchmark results with anything other than other SPEC
   OMP2012 benchmark results.  </p>


<h4 id="Q13">Q13. What metrics can be measured?</h4>

   <p class="l1">After the benchmarks are run on the system under test (SUT), a ratio for each of them is calculated using
   the run time on the SUT and a SPEC-determined <a href="#Q23">reference time</a>.  From these ratios, the following metrics
   are calculated:</p>

   <p class="l1">OMPG2012 (for OpenMP compute intensive parallel performance comparisons): </p>

    <ul class="l1">
     <li><p><b>Compute Performance metrics:</b></p>
        <ul>
        <li> <span class="newterm">SPECompG_base2012</span>: The geometric mean of fourteen normalized ratios when the benchmarks are compiled with <a href="#Q14">base</a> tuning.</li>
        <li> <span class="newterm">SPECompG_peak2012</span>: The geometric mean of fourteen normalized ratios when the benchmarks are compiled with <a href="#Q14">peak</a> tuning.</li>
        </ul>
     </li>
     <li><p><b>Energy Consumption metrics:</b></p>
        <ul>
        <li> <span class="newterm">SPECompG_energy_base2012</span>: The geometric mean of fourteen normalized ratios of the energy used with <a href="#Q14">base</a> tuning.</li>
        <li> <span class="newterm">SPECompG_energy_peak2012</span>: The geometric mean of fourteen normalized ratios of the energy used with <a href="#Q14">peak</a> tuning.</li>
        </ul>
     </li>
    </ul>


   <p class="l1">In all cases, a higher score means "better performance" on the given workload.</p>


<h4 id="Q14">Q14. What is the difference between a "base" metric and a "peak" metric?</h4>

   <p class="l1">In order to provide comparisons across different computer hardware, SPEC provides the benchmarks as source
   code.  Thus, in order to run the benchmarks, they must be compiled.  There is agreement that the benchmarks should be
   compiled the way users compile programs.  But how do users compile programs? </p>

   <ul class="l1">
      <li><p>Some users might experiment with many different compilers and compiler flags to achieve the best performance,
      and may be willing to develop multi-step make processes and "training" workloads.</p></li> 

      <li><p>Other users might prefer the relative simplicity of using a single set of switches and a single-step make
      process. </p></li>
   </ul>

   <p class="l1">In addition to the above, a wide range of other types of usage models could also be imagined, ranging in a
   continuum from <tt>-Odebug</tt> at the low end, to inserting directives and/or re-writing the source code at the high end.
   Which points on this continuum should SPEC OMP2012 allow?</p>

   <p class="l1">SPEC recognizes that any point chosen from that continuum might seem arbitrary to those whose interests lie
   at a different point.  Nevertheless, choices must be made.</p>

   <p class="l1">For OMP2012, SPEC has chosen to allow two types of compilation:</p>

   <ul class="l1">
        <li><p> The <span class="newterm">base</span> metrics (e.g. SPECompG_base2012) are required for all reported results
        and have stricter guidelines for compilation.  For example, the same flags must be used in the same order for all
        benchmarks of a given language.  This is the point closer to those who might prefer a relatively simple build
        process.</p></li>

        <li><p> The <span class="newterm">peak</span> metrics (e.g. SPECompG_peak2012) are optional and have less strict
        requirements.  For example, different compiler options may be used on each benchmark, and feedback-directed
        optimization is allowed.  This point is closer to those who may be willing to invest more time and effort in
        development of build procedures.</p></li>
    </ul>

   <p class="l1">Note that options allowed under the base metric rules are a subset of those allowed under the peak metric
   rules.  A legal base result is also legal under the peak rules but a legal peak result is NOT necessarily legal under the
   base rules.</p>

   <p class="l1">A full description of the distinctions and required guidelines can be found in the <a class="external"
   href="runrules.html">SPEC OMP2012 Run and Reporting Rules</a>.</p> 


<h4 id="Q15">Q15. What is the power metric?</h4>

   <p class="l1">With OMP2012, SPEC is providing a way to measure the 
power consumed during the benchmark run.
   </p>

    <ul class="l1">
        <li> The SPECompG_energy_base metric is the normalized power
        performance during the base run.
        <li> The SPECompG_energy_peak2012 metric is the normalized power
        performance during the peak run.
        </li>
    </ul>

   <p class="l1">The benchmark reports lists many other power measure data.
   </p>

<h4 id="Q16">Q16. Which SPEC OMP2012 metric should be used to compare performance?</h4>

   <p class="l1">It depends on your needs. SPEC provides the benchmarks and results as tools for you to use.  You need to
   determine how you use a computer or what your performance requirements are and then choose the appropriate SPEC benchmark
   or metrics.  </p>


<h4 id="Q17">Q17: SPEC OMP2001 is already available. Why create SPEC OMP2012? Will it show anything different?</h4>

   <p class="l1">Technology is always improving. As the technology improves, the benchmarks should improve as well. SPEC
   needed to address the following issues:</p> 

   <div class="l2">

      <p> <b>Scaling:</b>
      <br /> As of summer, 2012, many of the OMP2001 benchmarks are finishing in less than a minute on large parallel system.
      SPEC has attempted to address this with new benchmarks and data sets
to have good scaling to 512 OpenMP threads while running in a non-trivial
amount of time.
      </p> 

     <p> <b>OpenMP new features:</b>
     <br /> As the OpenMP standard has changed, additional features have been
added.  OMP2012 attempts to include many of these features.</p>

     <p> <b>Moving target:</b>
     <br /> OMP2001 has been available for eleven years and much improvement in hardware and software has occurred during this
     time. Benchmarks need to evolve to keep pace with improvements.  </p>

     <p> <b>Power measurement:</b>
     <br /> OMP2012 includes the optional ability to measure power
consumpution during the benchmark run. 
     </p>

  </div>

<h4 id="Q18">Q18: What happens to SPEC OMP2001 after SPEC OMP2012 is released?</h4>

   <p class="l1">SPEC will begin the process of retiring OMP2001. Three months after the announcement of OMP2012, SPEC
   will require all OMP2001 results submitted for publication on SPEC's web site to be accompanied by OMP2012 results. Six
   months after announcement, SPEC will stop accepting OMP2001 results for publication on its web site. </p>

<h4 id="Q19">Q19: Is there a way to translate SPEC OMP2001 results to SPEC OMP2012 results or vice versa?</h4>

   <p class="l1">There is no formula for converting OMP2001 results to OMP2012 results and vice versa; they are
   different products. There probably will be some correlation between OMP2001 and OMP2012 results (i.e., machines with
   higher OMP2001 results often will have higher OMP2012 results), but there is no universal formula for all systems.</p> 

   <p class="l1"> SPEC encourages SPEC licensees to publish OMP2012 numbers on older platforms to provide a historical
   perspective on performance.  </p>

<h4 id="Q20"> Q20: What criteria were used to select the benchmarks?</h4>

   <p class="l1">In the process of selecting applications to use as benchmarks, SPEC considered the following
   criteria:</p> 
        <ul class="l1">
          <li> portability to a variety of CPU architectures (32- and 64-bit including AMD64, Intel IA32, Power, SPARC, etc.) </li>
          <li> portability to various operating systems </li>
          <li> nearly all of the time is spent compute bound </li>
          <li> little time spent in IO and system services</li>
          <li> benchmarks should run in about 32GB RAM without swapping or paging </li>
          <li> no more than five percent of benchmarking time should be spent processing code not provided by SPEC</li>
        </ul>

<h4 id="Q21">Q21: Weren&#39;t some of the SPEC OMP2012 benchmarks in SPEC OMP2001? How are they different?</h4>

   <p class="l1">Although some of the benchmarks from OMP2001 are included in OMP2012, they all have been given different
   workloads and/or modified to use newer versions of the source code.  Therefore, for example, results with the OMP2001
   benchmark 312.swim_m may be strikingly different from results with the OMP2012 benchmark 363.swim.</p>

<h4 id="Q22">Q22: Why were some of the benchmarks not carried over from OMP2001?</h4>

   <p class="l1">Some benchmarks were not retained because it was not possible to create a longer-running or more robust
   workload. Others were left out because SPEC felt that they did not add significant performance information compared to the
   other benchmarks under consideration.</p>

<h4 id="Q23">Q23: Why does SPEC use a reference machine? What machine is used for SPEC OMP2012?</h4>

   <p class="l1">SPEC uses a reference machine to normalize the performance metrics used in the OMP2012 suites. Each
   benchmark is run and measured on this machine to establish a reference time for that benchmark. These times are then used
   in the SPEC calculations.</p> 

   <p class="l1">SPEC uses a historical Sun system, the "Sun Fire X4140" which was introduced in 2008, as the reference
   machine.  The reference machine uses two quad-core 2.7 GHz AMD Opteron 2384 processors with 32GB of memory.
   </p>
   
   <p class="l1">It takes about two days to do a rule-conforming run of the base metrics on the
   reference machine.  </p>

   <p class="l1"> Note that when comparing any two systems measured with the OMP2012, their performance relative to each
   other would remain the same even if a different reference machine was used. This is a consequence of the mathematics
   involved in calculating the individual and overall (geometric mean) metrics.  </p>

<h4 id="Q24"> Q24: How long does it take to run the SPEC OMP2012 benchmark suites?</h4>

   <p class="l1">This depends on the suite and the machine that is running the benchmarks. As mentioned above, the reference
   (historical) machine takes on the order of 2 days; contemporary machines might take less.
   Again, though, it depends on which metrics are run.</p>

<h4 id="Q25"> Q25: What if the tools cannot be run or built on a system? Can the benchmarks be run manually?</h4>

   <p class="l1">To generate rule-compliant results, an approved toolset must be used.  If several attempts at using the
   SPEC-provided tools are not successful, you should <a href="#Q28">contact SPEC for technical support</a>. SPEC may be able
   to help you, but this is not always possible -- for example, if you are attempting to build the tools on a platform that
   is not available to SPEC.</p>

   <p class="l1">If you just want to work with the benchmarks and do not care to generate publishable results, SPEC provides
   information about <a class="external" href="runspec-avoidance.html">how to do so</a>.</p> 


<h4 id="Q26">Q26: Where are SPEC OMP2012 results available?</h4>

   <p class="l1">Results for measurements submitted to SPEC are available at <a class="external"
   href="http://www.spec.org/omp2012/">http://www.spec.org/omp2012</a>.</p> 


<h4 id="Q27">Q27: Can SPEC OMP2012 results be published outside of the SPEC web site?  Do the rules still apply?</h4>

   <p class="l1">Yes, SPEC OMP2012 results can be freely published if all the run and reporting rules have been followed. The
   OMP2012 license agreement binds every purchaser of the suite to the run and reporting rules if results are quoted in
   public. A full disclosure of the details of a performance measurement must be provided on request. </p> 

   <p class="l1"> SPEC strongly encourages that results be submitted for publication on <a class="external"
   href="http://www.spec.org/omp2012/">SPEC's web site</a>, since it ensures a peer review process and uniform presentation of all
   results.  </p> 

   <p class="l1"> The run and reporting <a class="external" href="runrules.html#section4.5">rules for research and and academic
   contexts</a> recognize that it may not be practical to comply with the full set of rules in some contexts.  It is always
   required, however, that non-compliant results must be clearly distinguished from rule-compliant results.</p> 


<h4 id="Q28">Q28. How do I contact SPEC for more information or for technical support?</h4>

   <p class="l1">SPEC can be contacted in several ways. For general information, including other means of contacting SPEC,
   please see SPEC's Web Site at:</p>

<h4 id="Q29">Q29. Now that I have read this document, what should I do next?</h4>
   
   <p class="l1">If you haven't bought OMP2012, it is hoped that you will consider doing so.  If you are ready to get started
   using the suite, then you should pick a system that meets the requirements as described in </p>

   <p class="l2"><a class="external" href="system-requirements.html">system-requirements.html</a></p> 
   <p class="l1">and install the suite, following the instructions in</p>
