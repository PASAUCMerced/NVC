<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3 id="Require.01"><a name="memoryneeded">Require.01</a> 
<span class="question">q. How much memory do I need?
</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. 
The system requirements may be found in the document
   <a class="external"
   href="system-requirements.html">system-requirements.html</a>.
Currently, the minimum amount of memory in a system to run
has been 32 GB.</p> 


<h3 id="Require.02"><a name="nowindowds">Require.02</a>
<span class="question">q.  Does this work with Windows?</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. The SPEC OMP2012 suite has been tested on a number of
platforms, but Windows is not one of them.
Because of how this benchmark shares components with SPEC CPU
benchmarks, it is possible that it might work on Windows.
If you buy this benchmark and expect it to work on Windows, SPEC
will not be able to support you because it is not a supported 
operating system.
   </p> 


<!-- ...................... Installation .......................................  -->

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3 id="Install.01"><a name="installpermission">Install.01</a> 
<span class="question">q. Why am I getting a message such as "<span class="ttnobr">./install.sh: /bin/sh: bad interpreter:
Permission denied</span>"? </span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. If you are installing from the DVD, check to be sure that your operating system allows programs to be
   executed from the DVD.  For example, some Linux man pages for <tt>mount</tt> suggest setting the properties for the CD or DVD
   drive in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> to "<span class="ttnobr">/dev/cdrom  /cd  iso9660  ro,user,noauto,unhide</span>", which is notably
   missing the property "<tt>exec</tt>".  Add <tt>exec</tt> to that list in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>, or add it to your <tt>mount</tt>
   command.  Notice that the sample Linux <tt>mount</tt> command in <a class="external"
   href="install-guide-unix.html#mount">install-guide-unix.html</a> does include <tt>exec</tt>.</p> 

   <p class="answer">Perhaps <tt>install.sh</tt> lacks permission to run because you tried to copy all the files from the
   DVD, in order to move them to another system.  If so, please don't do that.  There's an easier way.  See the next
   question.</p>


<h3 id="Install.02"><a name="nodvd">Install.02</a>
<span class="question">q.  The DVD drive is on system A, but I want to install on system B.  What do I do?</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. The installation guides have an appendix just for you, which describe installing from the network or
   installing from a tarfile.  See Appendix 1 in <a class="external"
   href="install-guide-unix.html#appendix1">install-guide-unix.html</a> or <a class="external"
   href="install-guide-windows.html#appendix1">install-guide-windows.html</a>.</p> 


<h3 id="Install.03">Install.03
<span class="question">q. Why did the installation fail with <tt>Error occurred while processing: C:\Documents</tt>?  
</span></h3>

<p class="question">I was installing on Windows using the tar file.  It said:</p>
<pre class="pquestion">
C:\Documents and Settings\John\omp2012&gt; <b>install</b>
The environment variable SPEC should point to the source of the
SPEC distribution as an absolute path.  I will now try to set
the variable for you...

SPEC is set to C:\Documents and Settings\John\omp2012
If this is NOT what you want, press control-C
Press any key to continue . . .
Installing from "C:\Documents and Settings\John\omp2012"

Checking the integrity of your source tree...

 Depending on the amount of memory in your system, and the speed of your
 destination disk, this may take more than 10 minutes.
 Please be patient.

The system cannot find the file specified.
Error occurred while processing: C:\Documents.
The system cannot find the file specified.
Error occurred while processing: and.
The system cannot find the path specified.
C:\Documents and Settings\John\omp2012\tools\bin\windows-i386\specmd5sum: MANIFEST.tmp: no properly formatted MD5 checksum lines found
Package integrity check failed!
Installation NOT completed!
</pre>

   <p class="answer">a. Even though Windows is not a supported OS for 
SPEC OMP2012, it is possible that things will work.  The problem is that the SPEC tools do NOT support spaces in path names.  This is a limitation
   of the SPEC toolset and there are currently no plans to change this requirement.  Please use a path that does not contain
   spaces.  </p>

<h3 id="Install.04"><a name="uninstall">Install.04</a>
<span class="question">q. How do I uninstall? This script <tt>uninstall.sh</tt> doesn't seem to be it.
</span></h3>


   <p class="answer">a. You are correct that <tt>uninstall.sh</tt> does not remove the whole product; it only removes the
   SPEC tool set, and does not affect the benchmarks (which consume the bulk of the disk space).  At this time, SPEC does not
   provide an uninstall utility for the suite as a whole.  But it's easy to do: on Unix systems, use <span class="ttnobr">rm
   -Rf</span> on the directory where you installed the suite, for example:</p>  

       <pre>  rm -Rf /home/cs3000/saturos/spec/omp2012</pre>

   <p class="answer">On Windows systems, select the top directory in Windows Explorer and delete it.</p>

   <p class="answer">If you have been using the <a class="external" href="runspec.html#output_root">output_root</a> feature,
   you will have to track those down separately.  See the suggested commands in the appendix about uninstalling, in the <a
   class="external" href="install-guide-unix.html#uninstall">install guides</a>.</p> 

   <p class="answer">Note: instead of deleting the entire directory tree, some users find it useful to keep the
   <tt>config</tt> and <tt>result</tt> subdirectories, while deleting everything else.  </p>


<h3 id="Install.05">Install.05 Do I need to be <tt>root</tt>?</h3>

   <p class="question">Occasionally, users of Unix systems have asked whether it is necessary to elevate privileges, or to
   become <tt>'root'</tt>, prior to installing or running SPEC OMP2012.</p>

   <p class="answersnugbot">a.  SPEC recommends&nbsp;(*) that you do <span class="u">not</span> become <tt>root</tt>,
   because: (1)&nbsp;To the best of SPEC's knowledge, no component of SPEC OMP needs to modify system directories, nor does
   any component need to call privileged system interfaces.  (2)&nbsp;Therefore, if you find that it appears that there is
   some reason why you need to be <tt>root</tt>, the cause is likely to be outside the SPEC toolset - for example, disk
   protections, or quota limits.  (3)&nbsp;<span class="u">For safe benchmarking</span>, it is better to avoid being
   <tt>root</tt>, for the same reason that it is a good idea to wear seat belts in a car: accidents happen, humans make
   mistakes.  For example, if you accidentally type:</p>
   <div style="margin-left:6em"><span class="ttnobr">kill 1</span></div> 
   <p class="answersnug">when you meant to say:</p>
   <div style="margin-left:6em"><span class="ttnobr">kill %1</span></div> 
   <p class="answersnugtop">then you will very grateful if you are <span class="u">not</span> privileged at that moment.
   </p>

   <p class="example">(*) This is only a recommendation, not a requirement nor a rule.</p>

<!-- ...................... runspec .......................................  -->

<h2>runspec</h2>

<h3 id="runspec.01"><a name="perlpath">runspec.01</a> <span class="question">q. When I say <tt>runspec</tt>, why does it say
<tt>Can't locate strict.pm</tt>?  For example:</span></h3>

<pre class="pquestion">
D:\omp2012&gt;<b>runspec --help</b>
Can't locate strict.pm in @INC (@INC contains: .) at
D:\omp2012\bin\runspec line 62.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at D:\omp2012\bin\runspec line 62.
</pre>

   <p class="answer">a. You can't use <tt>runspec</tt> if its path is not set correctly.  On Unix, Linux, or Mac OS X, you should
   source <tt>shrc</tt> or <tt>cshrc</tt>, as described in <a class="external" href="runspec.html#section2.4">runspec.html section
   2.4</a>.  For Windows, please edit <tt>shrc.bat</tt> and make the adjustments described in the comments.  Then, execute that
   file, as described in <a class="external" href="runspec.html#section2.5">runspec.html section 2.5</a>.</p> 


<h3 id="runspec.02">runspec.02
<span class="question">q. Why am I getting messages about <tt>specperl: bad interpreter</tt>?  For example:
</span></h3>
<pre class="pquestion">
bash: /omp2012newdir/bin/runspec: /omp2012/bin/specperl: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
</pre>

   <p class="answer">a. Did you move the directory where <tt>runspec</tt> was installed?  If so, you can probably put
   everything to rights, just by going to the new top of the directory tree and typing "<tt>bin/relocate</tt>".
   </p>

   <p class="answer">For example, the following unwise sequence of events is repaired after completion of the final line.</p>

<pre>
Top of SPEC benchmark tree is '/omp2012'
Everything looks okay.  cd to /omp2012,
source the shrc file and have at it!
$ <b>cd /omp2012</b>
$ <b>. ./shrc</b>
$ <b>cd ..</b>
$ <b>mv omp2012 omp2012newdir</b>
$ <b>runspec -h | head</b>
bash: runspec: command not found
$ <b>cd omp2012newdir/</b>
$ <b>. ./shrc</b>
$ <b>runspec --help | head</b>
bash: /omp2012newdir/bin/runspec: /omp2012/bin/specperl: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
$ <b>bin/relocate</b>
</pre>


<h3 id="runspec.03">runspec.03 Do I need to be <tt>root</tt>?</h3>

   <p class="answer">Regarding the <tt>root</tt> account, the answer for <tt>runspec</tt> is the same as the answer for <a
   href="#Install.05">installation</a> question #5, above.</p>


<!-- ...................... Building .......................................  -->

<h2>Building benchmarks</h2>

<h3 id="Build.01"><a name="winpath">Build.01</a> <span class="question">q. I'm using Windows and I can't build any
benchmarks.   What does <tt>CreateProcess((null), ifort ...) failed</tt> mean?  For example:</span></h3>

<pre class="pquestion">
Error with make 'specmake build': check file
'D:/omp2012/benchspec/OMP2012/350.md/run/build_base_omp2012.win32.fast.exe.0000/make.err'
  Error with make!
*** Error building 350.md
-----
make.err:
process_begin: CreateProcess((null), ifort -c -Foblock_solver.obj -Ox block_solver.f, ...) failed.
make (e=2): The system cannot find the file specified.

specmake: *** [block_solver.obj] Error 2     
</pre>

   <p class="answer">a.  Please note that Windows is not an officially supported platform (see 
   <a class="external" href="system-requirements.html">system-requirements.html</a>).  It may be possible that Windows will work, so this answer may be of use to you.
</p>
   <p class="answer">This <tt>CreateProcess</tt> failure occurs on Windows when <tt>specmake</tt> cannot find your compiler. 
   (Recall from <a class="external" href="system-requirements.html">system-requirements.html</a> that the benchmarks are supplied
   in source code form, and that they must be compiled.)</p> 

   <p class="answer">The reason that it cannot find your compiler is, most likely, because: </p>
   <ol> 
      <li>You have not edited <tt>shrc.bat</tt> to correctly reference your compiler, or </li>
      <li>You have used a config file that references a compiler that does not exist. </li> 
   </ol>

   <p class="answer">To fix your problem, investigate and address both items.</p>

   <ol class="answer"> <li><p>In <tt>shrc.bat</tt>, you need to either:</p>

      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
      <li><p>Reference a vendor-supplied file that sets the path.</p>

         <p>The supplied <tt>shrc.bat</tt> in V1.0 mentions sample <span class="ttnobr">.bat</span> files that are often
         provided by compilers to set your environment.  If you want to use this option but you can't find the right file,
         check your compiler documentation, or you might try searching your hard drive for <span
         class="ttnobr">*vars*bat</span>.</p>
         
         <p>The file names change frequently; check your compiler docs.  </p>

         <p class="example" style="margin-left:5em;">For example, for Visual Studio 10, you might use something like <span
         class="ttnobr">call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat" </span> but for
         older compilers, you might need to look for <span class="ttnobr">v<span
         class="alarm"><b>c</b></span>vars32.bat</span>, not <span class="ttnobr">v<span
         class="alarm"><b>s</b></span>vars32.bat</span>.  </p>
         
         <p class="example" style="margin-left:5em;">For example, when using the (mid-2011) Intel compiler, to select 32 or
         64-bit mode, you must remember
         to add the appropriate argument after the call.  This statement requests 32-bit mode: <br /><span class="ttnobr">call
         "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\ComposerXE-2011\bin\compilervars.bat" ia32</span></p>

         <p class="example" style="margin-left:5em;">For example, when using the PGI 11.7 compiler, the path varies depending
         on whether you are using 32 or 64-bit mode:<br /><span class="ttnobr">
         call "c:\Program Files\PGI\win64\11.7\pgi_env.bat"</span> <br />or 
         <br /><span class="ttnobr"> call "c:\Program Files (x86)\PGI\win32\11.7\pgi_env.bat"</span></p>

         <p><span class="u">Summary: your call statement will vary,</span>  by compiler, by version, and sometimes, by
         features.  Check your compiler's documentation, to find the right call.</p>
         </li>

      <li><p>Or, edit the path yourself.</p>

         <p class="l1">You can set the path yourself if you like, with commands such as: </p>
         <pre>set PATH=%PATH%;"c:\program files\path\to\my\compiler\bin"</pre>  
         <p class="l1">If you want to use option b, but you can't figure out what path to set, try looking in the
         documentation for your compiler under topics such as "setting the path", or "command line", or "environment
         variables".  The documentation should mention whether any other environment variables (such as LIB or INCLUDE) are
         required, in addition to PATH.</p></li>

      </ol>
   </li>


   <li><p>You must also use a config file that is appropriate for your compiler.  
   </p></li>

<h3 id="Build.03"><a name="rebuild">Build.03</a> <span class="question">q. Why is it rebuilding the benchmarks?
</span></h3>

<p class="answer">a. You changed something, and the tools thought that it might affect the generated binaries.  
</p> 


<!-- ...................... setup .......................................  -->
<h2>Setting up</h2>

<h3 id="Setup.01">Setup.01 <span class="question">q. What does <tt> hash doesn't match after copy </tt> mean?</span></h3>

   <p class="question">I got this strange, difficult to reproduce message:
   <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hash doesn't match after copy ... in copy_file (1 try total)!  Sleeping 2 seconds...</tt> 
   <br />followed by several more tries and sleeps. Why?</p>

   <p class="answer">a. During benchmark setup, certain files are checked.  If they don't match what they are expected to,
   you might see this message.  Check:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Are you out of disk space?</li>
   <li>Does the error go away if a different disk is used?  Perhaps you have a bad disk, or an unreliable disk controller.
   </li>
   </ul> <p class="answer">If the condition persists, try turning up the <a class="external"
   href="config.html#verbose">verbosity</a> level.  Look at the files with other tools; do they exist?  Can you see differences? 
   Try a different disk and controller.  And, check for the specific instance of this message described in the next question.</p> 


<h3 id="Setup.02">Setup.02<span class="question">q. Why does it say <tt>ERROR: Copying executable failed?</tt></span></h3>

   <p class="question">I got this strange, difficult to reproduce message:
   <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ERROR: Copying executable to run directory FAILED</tt> <br />or 
   <br /><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ERROR: Copying executable from build dir to exe dir FAILED!</tt> 
   <br />along with the bit about hashes not matching from the previous question.  Why?</p>

   <p class="answer">a. Perhaps you have attempted to build the same benchmark twice in two simultaneous jobs.  </p>
   
   <p class="answer">On most operating systems, the SPEC tools don't mind concurrent jobs.  They use your operating system's
   locking facilities to write the correct outputs to the correct files, even if you fire off many <tt>runspec</tt> commands
   at the same time.  </p>
   
   <p class="answer">But there's one case of simultaneous building that is difficult for the tools to defend against: please
   don't try to build the very same executable from two different jobs at the same time.  Notice that if you say something
   like this:</p>
<pre>
$ <b>tail myconfig.cfg</b>
350.md=peak:
basepeak=yes
$ <b>runspec --config myconfig --size test --tune base 350.md &amp;</b>
$ <b>runspec --config myconfig --size test --tune peak 350.md &amp;</b>
</pre>
   <p class="answer">then you are trying to build the same benchmark twice in two different jobs, because of the presence of
   <tt>basepeak=yes</tt>.  Please don't try to do that.</p>






<!-- ...................... running .......................................  -->
<h2>Running benchmarks</h2>


<h3 id="Run.01">Run.01
<span class="question">q. Why does this benchmark suite take so long to run?
</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. Please understand that the suite has been designed to be useful for at least 5 years.   Benchmarks that
   seem slow today probably will not seem slow at the end of life of the suite.  
   </p> 


<h3 id="Run.02">Run.02 <span class="question">q. Why was there this cryptic message from the operating system?</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. If you are getting cryptic, hard-to-reproduce, unpredictable error messages from your system, one possible
   reason may be that the benchmarks consume substantial resources, of several types.  If an OS runs out of some resource - for
   example, pagefile space, or process heap space - it might not give you a very clear message.  Instead, you might see only a
   very brief message, or a diaolog box with a hex error code in it.  Please see the hints and suggestions in the section about
   resources in <a class="external" href="system-requirements.html#resources">system-requirements.html</a>.</p>

   <p class="question">Why did it say that?  What's the problem?</p>

   <p class="answer">a. We don't know.  Many things can cause a benchmark to miscompare, so we
   really can't tell you exactly what's wrong based only on the fact that a miscompare occurred. </p> 

   <p class="answer">But don't panic. </p>

   <p class="answer">Please notice, if you read the message carefully, that there's a suggestion of a very specific file to look in.  It may be a little hard to read if you have a narrow terminal window, as in the example above, but if you look carefully you'll see that it says:</p>

</pre>

<p class="answer">Now's the time to look inside that file.  Simply doing so <b>may</b> provide a clue as to the nature of your
   problem.  </p>
   <p class="answer">On Unix systems, change your current directory to the run directory using the path mentioned in the
   message, for example:</p>

<pre>cd /spec/omp2012/21/benchspec/OMP2012/358.botsalgn/run/run_base_ref_12.3.0000
</pre>

   <p class="answer">On Microsoft Windows systems, remember to turn the slashes backwards in your cd command.  </p>

   <p class="answer">Then, have a look at the file that was mentioned, using your favorite text editor.  If the file does not
   exist, then <a href="#make.clean.err">check your paths</a>, and check to see whether you have run out of disk space.</p>

<h3 id="Miscompare.02">Miscompare.02 <span class="question"> The benchmark ran, but it took less than 1 second and there was
a miscompare.  Help!</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. If the benchmark took less than 1 second to execute, it didn't execute properly.  There should be one
   or more <tt>.err</tt> files in the run directory which will contain some clues about why the benchmark failed to run.
   Common causes include libraries that were used for compilation but not available during the run, executables that crash
   with access violations or other exceptions, and permissions problems.  See also the suggestions in the next question.</p>

<h3 id="Miscompare.03">Miscompare.03 <span class="question">  I looked in the <tt>.mis</tt> file and it said something
like:</span></h3>
<pre class="pquestion">
   'rand.234923.out' short
</pre>
   <p class="question">What does "short" mean?</p>

   <p class="answer">a. If a line like the above is the only line in the <tt>.mis</tt> file, it means that the benchmark
   failed to produce any output.  In this case, the corresponding error file (look for files with <tt>.err</tt> extensions in
   the run directory) may have a clue.  In this case, it was <tt>Segmentation Fault - core dumped</tt>.  For problems like
   this, the first things to examine are the portability flags used to build the benchmark.  </p>

   <p class="answer">Have a look at the sample config files in <span class="ttnobr">$SPEC/config</span> or, on Windows, <span
   class="ttnobr">%SPEC%\config</span>.  If you constructed your own config file based on one of those, maybe you picked a
   starting point that was not really appropriate (e.g. you picked a 32-bit config file but are using 64-bit compilation options).
    Have a look at other samples in that directory.  Check at <a class="external"
   href="http://www.spec.org/omp2012/">www.spec.org/omp2012</a> to see if there have been any result submissions using the
   platform that you are trying to test.  If so, compare your portability flags to the ones in the the config files for those
   results.</p> 

   <p class="answer">If the portability flags are okay, your compiler may be generating bad code.</p>

<h3 id="Miscompare.04">Miscompare.04 <span class="question"> My compiler is generating bad code!  Help!</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. Try reducing the optimization that the compiler is doing.  Instructions for doing this will vary from
   compiler to compiler, so it's best to ask your compiler vendor for advice if you can't figure out how to do it for
   yourself.</p>

<h3 id="Miscompare.05">Miscompare.05 <span class="question"> My compiler is generating bad code with low or no optimization!  Help!</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. If you're using a beta compiler, try dropping down to the last released version, or get a newer copy
   of the beta.  If you're using a version of GCC that shipped with your OS, you may want to try getting a "vanilla" (no
   patches) version and building it yourself.</p>

<h3 id="Miscompare.06">Miscompare.06 <span class="question"> I looked in the <span class="ttnobr">.mis</span> file and it was
just full of a bunch of numbers.</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. In this case, the benchmark is probably running, but it's not generating answers that are within the
   tolerances set.  See the suggestions for how to deal with compilers that generate bad code in the previous two questions.
   In particular, you might see if there is a way to encourage your compiler to be careful about optimization of floating
   point expressions.</p>

<h2>Results reporting </h2>

<h3 id="Results.01">Results.01 
<span class="question">q. Where did the reference times go?
</span></h3>

   <p class="question">I was reading an HTML (or PDF or PS) report and see that in the table SPEC now prints all three
   observations as both seconds and ratio, with the bold underlined item for the median.  Although this is useful, CPU2000
   results reports included the reference times in their own column, and I miss them.  Yes, I understand that the ratio
   is defined as <span class="ttnobr">reference time / observed time</span>, so I could calculate the reference times by
   simple multiplication.  Nevertheless, it was nice having them handy in the previous report format.  </p>

   <p class="answer">a. Because of space issues, the reference times are no longer
available in the actual reports.  They can be found by examining the
<tt>reftime</tt> files in the <tt>data/ref</tt> directories of the 
individual benchmarks.  They are also provided in the table below

<span class="question">q. What is a "flags file"?  What does the message <tt> Unknown Flags </tt> mean in a report?
</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a.  SPEC OMP2012 provides benchmarks in source code form, which are compiled under control of SPEC's
   toolset. Compilation flags (such as <tt>-O5</tt> or <tt>-unroll</tt>) are detected and reported by the tools with the
   help of flag description files.  Therefore, to do a complete run, you need to (1) point to an existing flags file (easy)
   or (2) modify an existing flags file (slightly harder) or (3) write one from scratch (definitely harder).</p>

   <ol class="answer">

   <li style="margin-bottom:.8em;" class="answer"> Find an existing flags file by noticing the address of the <tt>.xml</tt> file
   at the bottom of any result published at <a class="external" href="http://www.spec.org/omp2012/">www.spec.org/omp2012</a>.  You
   can use the <a class="external" href="runspec.html#flagsurl">--flagsurl</a> switch to point your own <tt>runspec</tt> command
   at that file, or you can reference it from your config file with the <a class="external"
   href="config.html#flagsurl">flagsurl</a> option.  For example: <br />

   for convenience the tools try to tell you as much as they can about how the result should be improved if you were to submit it.
    In the above example, the tools would stop complaining if the field <tt>hw_memory</tt> said something like "20 GB" instead of
   "20480 Megabytes". </p>

<h2>Power</h2>

<h3 id="Power.01">Power.01 
<span class="question">q. What is the power component of SPEC OMP2012?
</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. As part of the the update to the SPEC OMP benchmark suite,
a power measurement component was added.  This optional feature allows the power
consumed during the benchmark to be reported.
   </p>


<h3 id="Power.02">Power.02
<span class="question">q. Am I required to run power?
</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. The measurement of power is optional. It requires
a methology that SPEC has been developing starting with the SPECpower_ssj2008
benchmark.
   </p>


<h3 id="Power.03"><a name="flagsfile">Power.03</a>
<span class="question">q. How do I measure power?
</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. Please see the  
   <a class="external" href="http://www.spec.org/omp2012/Docs/runrules.html#section3.1.3">runrules</a> as a starting point for what is required to run and
measure power.
In order to create a submittable run, you will need an approved power analyzer
which has been calibrated within the past year by an appropriate testing
organization.  You will have to connect your system up to the power analyzer.
You will need to use the provided tools and set up your 
   <a class="external" href="http://www.spec.org/omp2012/Docs/config.html#power">
configuration file</a> to tell it how to use power.  
Another place to look for help in how to set up your configuration file
is in published OMP2012 results at 
   <a class="external" href="http://www.spec.org">
www.spec.org</a>.
   </p>

<h3 id="Power.04"><a name="flagsfile">Power.04</a>
<span class="question">q. What kind of power analyzer do I need?
</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. Please see the  
   <a class="external" href="http://www.spec.org/power/docs/SPECpower-Device_List.html#mozTocId266535">
list of accepted power analyzers</a>.
The list contains those power analyzers that can be used for 
making reportable runs.
   </p>


<h3 id="Power.05">Power.05
<span class="question">q. Is it possible to retrieve all of the sample
data collected from the power analyzer?
</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. 
Power data is sampled at 1 second intervals.  This data
is stored in the created raw file (<tt>.rsf</tt>) that is
created after a run finishes.
As an example, to extract the data, you would run
<ul class="answer">
<tt>
specperl $SPEC/bin/scripts.misc/extract_misc spec.omp2012.idle_powersamples <raw file>
</tt>
</ul> 
<p class="answer">
The output will go to the screen.
   </p> 
   <p class="answer">
The general format of the command is
<ul class="answer">
<tt>
Usage: /export/bmk/omp2012.21/bin/scripts.misc/extract_misc <section> <file>
</tt>
</ul>
<p class="answer">
Where the section will look something like
<ul class="answer">
<tt>
  spec.omp2012.results.&lt;benchmark&gt;.&lt;base|peak&gt;.&lt;iter&gt;.powersamples
</tt>
</ul>
<p class="answer">
where <tt>&lt;benchmark&gt;</tt> is the full benchmark name, <tt>&lt;iter&gt;</tt> is the iteration
number (3 digits).
   </p> 

<h3 id="Power.06">Power.06
<span class="question">q.  What settings are required for the power analyzer?  </span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. 
For instructions how to setup the power analyzers and to run the SPEC PTDaemon 
please consult the SPECpower Measurement Setup Guide which you can find in
the PTDaemon tree.
</p>


<h3 id="Power.07">Power.07
<span class="question">q.  Can I use autoranging?  </span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. In order to minimize measurement errors, the
autoranging feature should not be used.  If the measurement range 
is too great for your power analyzer for a benchmark run, you can set
your measurement rang on a per-benchmark basis.
Please check the <a class="external" href="config.html"> config.html</a> document 
for more on how to set the per-benchmark controls.
</p>

<h3 id="Power.08">Power.08
<span class="question">q.  The <tt>runspec</tt> command caused
uncertainty errors, what can I do?</span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. There could be lots of answers.  Are the 
values being returned during the run within the measurement
capabilities that have been set for your power analyzer?  Maybe you
need to set the range on a per benchmark basis.
</p>
<p class="answer">If that isn't the problem, you probably need to
see if PTDaemon is reporting any errors.  If you did not enable
PTDaemon with logging, consider restarting it and adding
the <tt>-l file1</tt> and <tt> -d file2</tt> options to capture
more information.  These may lead you to finding the answer.</p>

<h3 id="Power.09">Power.09
<span class="question">q.  Can I use more than one power analyzer?  </span></h3>

   <p class="answer">a. Yes, it is possible to use more than one
power analyzer.  Just provide the information in the configuration file
to tell the benchmarks which connections to check for the power analyzers.
</p>


<!-- ...................... temperature  ...............................  -->
<h2>Temperature</h2>

<h3 id="Temp.01">Temperature.01 
<span class="question">q.  I got an error about it being too cold, what can I do? 
</span></h3>
<p class="question">
ERROR: Minimum temperature during the run (19.5 degC) is less than the minimum a
llowed (20 degC)
</p>

   <p class="answer">a. The benchmark requires that the minimum inflow temperature be at 20 degC or higher.  
This value was chosen to prevent artificially good result by trying to influence the
performance of the machine by keeping it colder than normal.
To get a submission quality result, you will need to find a warmer
spot in your data center to do your runs.
