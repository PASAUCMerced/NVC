<h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>SPEC supplies various tools that are used to ensure consistent operation of benchmarks across a variety of platforms.  In
order to generate a valid result file which can be submitted to SPEC, you must use the SPEC supplied tools.</p>

<h3 id="what">1.a. What are the tools?</h3>

<p>The tools include (but are not limited to):</p>

  <table>
  <tr> <th>specdiff    </th><td> examines results to see if the correct answer was obtained</td></tr>
  <tr> <th>specinvoke  </th><td> invokes benchmarks for OMP2012</td></tr>

  <tr> <th>specmake    </th> 
                  <td> GNU <tt>make</tt> (Calling it "<tt>specmake</tt>" avoids possible conflicts with versions of
                  <tt>make</tt> that may already be on your system.  SPEC requires that published results use the versions of
                  the tools that it supplies, so that if SPEC applies patches or extensions from time to time, all users run
                  with a consistent tool set.  Similar considerations apply to other tools in this list.)</td></tr>

  <tr> <th>specxz      </th><td> The <tt>xz</tt> compression program     </td></tr>
  <tr> <th>specmd5sum  </th><td> <tt>md5sum</tt> from GNU coreutils, with enhancements</td></tr>
  <tr> <th>spectar     </th><td> GNU <tt>tar</tt>   </td></tr>
  <tr> <th>specperl    </th><td> Perl </td></tr>
  <tr> <td colspan="2">Various Perl modules such as Algorithm::Diff, GD, HTML::Parser, PDF::API2, URI, XML::SAX, etc.</td></tr>
  </table>

<p>Many of these tools are based on the freely available programs of the same name.  </p>

<p>Note: In this document, "Unix" is used to describe Unix and all Unix-like systems such as Linux.</p>

<h3 id="precompiled">1.b. Pre-compiled binaries</h3>

<p>You will find pre-compiled binaries for the tools in the directories:</p>

    <p class="l1ex">$SPEC/tools/bin/&lt;archname&gt;</p>

<p>The term <tt>$SPEC</tt> designates the top directory where you installed the benchmark suite.  (On a Windows system, it
would be called <tt>%SPEC%</tt>.)</p>

<p>The precompiled binaries will be automatically installed when you run
    <span class="ttnobr">install.sh</span>  (Unix) or 
    <span class="ttnobr">install.bat</span> (Windows).</p>


<h3 id="when2build">1.c. When to build the tools yourself</h3>

<p>Sometimes it may be necessary to rebuild the tools, for example if a change in an operating system renders a precompiled
binary inoperable, or if you are the first person to add support for a new architecture.</p>

<p>It is generally not possible to do cross-compilation of Perl, as Perl's build process involves running binaries generated
during the build.  Therefore, getting a toolset onto an embedded platform without a native compiler is most likely impossible.</p>

<p id="logit"><span class="alarm"><b>NOTICE: </b></span>If you are adding support for a new architecture, and intend to submit results
to SPEC, you must ask SPEC to review your tool build.  Please <span class="alarm"><b>turn on your operating system's session
recorder</b></span> (e.g. in Unix, typically the <span class="ttnobr">script</span> command) prior to doing
<tt>buildtools</tt>.  In Windows, you might have to do repetitious tedious repeated cut/paste clicking and clicking (so make
that command window as big as possible).  Also, you will be expected to provide the output from <span class="ttnobr">runspec
-V</span> and <span class="ttnobr">runspec --test</span> on a system OTHER than the build system, where you have installed
your new tools build.</p>


<h2 id="how">2. How to build the tools</h2>

<p>If the directory <span class="ttnobr">$SPEC/tools/src</span> (Unix) or <span class="ttnobr">%SPEC%\tools\src</span> (Windows)
does not yet exist, use xz and tar to expand <span class="ttnobr">install_archives/omp2012.tar.xz</span> into a writable directly
local to the build system.  (Building tools on networked filesystems can work, but it's more likely to make some of GNU tar's
tests fail, so it's safer to build on a local filesystem.)</p>

<p class="l1ex">xz -dc install_archives/omp2012.tar.xz | tar -xf - tools/src</p>

<p>The scripts <span class="ttnobr">$SPEC/tools/src/buildtools</span>     (Unix) or <span
class="ttnobr">%SPEC%\tools\src\buildtools.bat</span> (Windows) will build the tools.  But you may need to invoke the
<tt>buildtools</tt> script with appropriate environment variables set first - see the sections immediately following that
provide notes about specific platforms.</p>

<p>You will need a C99 compiler.  Most of the tools are C++ or C89, but XZ is C99.</p>

<p>If everything goes right, you won't have to do very much at all, other than watch build commands fly by.  </p>


<h3 id="unix">2.a. Notes specific to Unix systems</h3>

<p>When building the tools under Unix, the following warnings appear to be harmless as of May 2012:</p>

   <ul>
   <li> Any message generated by a "make clean", especially the first time that you build, since there's nothing to
   clean!</li>

   <li> Warnings about missing 'makeinfo', 'alocal', 'automake', 'autoconf'.</li>
   </ul>

<p>You may find the following flags useful on the listed systems:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><p>AIX (32-bit): 
    <br /><tt>CC=xlc CFLAGS='-O -qarch=ppc -D_LARGE_FILES -D_ILS_MACROS' PERLFLAGS="-Doptimize='-O' -Accflags='-D_LARGE_FILES'" OBJECT_MODE=32 ./buildtools</tt></p></li>
  <li><p>AIX (64-bit): 
    <br /><tt>CC=xlc CFLAGS='-O3 -qarch=ppc64 -q64 -D_ILS_MACROS' PERLFLAGS="-Doptimize='-O' -Aoptimize='-qarch=ppc64 -q64'" OBJECT_MODE=64 ./buildtools</tt></p></li>

  <li><p>HPUX:
    <br /><tt>CC="/opt/ansic/bin/cc" CFLAGS="-Ae +O2 +z -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -AC99" XZCFLAGS=-AC99 PERLFLAGS="-Doptimize=+O1 -Dlibpth=/usr/lib/hpux32 -Dldflags=-lm -Dcppstdin=cc -Acppstdin=-E -Acppstdin=-Aa -Acppstdin=-D__STDC_EXT__ -Acppstdin=-AC89" ./buildtools</tt></p></li>

  <li><p>IRIX:
    <br /><tt>ulimit -s 128000; CFLAGS="-c99 -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64" MD5CFLAGS="-O2" PERLFLAGS="-Doptimize=-O3 -Uloclib -Dlibpth=/usr/lib32" XZFLAGS="--disable-assembler --disable-shared" XZCFLAGS="-O1" ./buildtools</tt></p></li>
   </ul>

<p><b>Check out those who have gone before.</b>  If the system for which you're attempting to build tools is similar to one
for which a tools build exists, you may gain insight by looking at the top of the build logs in <span
class="ttnobr">tools/src/buildtools.log</span>.   Even if your system is very unusual and very different than previous
systems, it is probably still worth your while to look over the previous logs.   You don't have to read all 20,000 lines;
just check out the environment variables and path settings and so forth from the top of previous builds.</p>


<h3 id="windows">2.b. Notes specific to Windows systems</h3>

<p>Because XZ is written in C99, no version of Visual Studio (as of May 2012) can be used to build the tools.  Instead,
the Windows version of buildtools is designed to use the MinGW GCC compiler.  It has been tested successfully with both 4.3 and
4.5 versions of GCC; the latest version available should be used.  The tools are not yet ported to be built with a 64-bit compiler;
use the 32-bit tools instead.</p>

<p>The builds use makefiles to be processed with either mingw-make.exe (which is GNU make) or dmake.exe (which is built in the
process of building tools).  The full MSYS environment is not used, so all of the makefiles are pre-generated; the GNU autoconf
system is not used.  Compiler flags are defined in those pre-generated makefiles.<br />
Building tools under Cygwin is not supported and probably won't work.</p>

<p>If it is necessary to unzip and untar the sources of the tools in Windows, open a Command-Prompt window, cd to
<tt>%SPEC%</tt> (i.e. the top directory of SPEC). Then execute:</p>

<pre>
  cd tools
  bin\windows-i386\specxz.exe -d install_archives/omp2012.tar.xz
  ooo\windows-i386\spectar.exe -xvf install_archives/omp2012.tar
</pre>

<p>Then go ahead and execute </p>

      <p class="l1ex">%SPEC%\tools\src\buildtools.bat </p>

<p>You can ignore warnings about objects that are not found, especially at the beginning of each tool build, when cleanup is
attempted from previous builds.  Some tools may not know how to make '<tt>clean</tt>', '<tt>distclean</tt>', or
'<tt>realclean</tt>'; don't worry about it.</p>

<p>In Windows XP with Service Pack 2 or later, there may be a Security Alert, depending on the Firewall settings. "Windows Firewall
has blocked this program from accepting connections from the Internet or a network." You may ignore this warning.</p>

<p>All compiler warnings seen as of May 2012 appear to be harmless.</p>

<h2 id="verify">3. How to verify that your build succeeded</h2>

<p>After a tool build, you should: </p>

<pre>
  cd $SPEC (Unix) or %SPEC% (Windows)

  shrc.bat (Windows)
  . ./shrc (Unix, if you are in an sh-compatible shell.  
                  If not, start one!)  

  See if you can at least get as far as asking the major tools
  to identify themselves:

       runspec -V 

  Or you can ask individual tools about themselves:

       specmake -v 
       specxz -h
       specperl -v
       specdiff -h
       runspec -h 
       specinvoke -h 

</pre>

<p>Running <span class="ttnobr">runspec --test</span> will run more comprehensive tests on specperl.</p>

<h2 id="describe">4. Describing your newly-built tools</h2>

<p>As a courtesy to others who might like to know which systems you intended your new tools to work on, and to describe the
environment in which they were built, you may write a short description file.  The contents of this file will be displayed
when <tt>install.sh</tt> is run.  Windows users only have one choice, and thus no description is printed.  The file is <span
class="ttnobr">$SPEC/tools/bin/&lt;archname&gt;/description</span>.  If that directory does not exist, you should create it.  (If
the directory does not exist, <tt>packagetools</tt> will create it, but in order for the description to be packaged, it must
be present <span class="u">before</span> <tt>packagetools</tt> is run.)  See the <a href="#package">"Packagetools"</a> section
below for guidance about picking "<span class="ttnobr">&lt;archname&gt;</span>".</p>

<p>The format is very simple; in order to avoid wrapping on an 80-column screen, the first line must be no longer than 50
characters.  In order to line up properly, subsequent lines should begin with 30 spaces and be no longer than 80 columns
total.</p>

<p>For example, given <span class="ttnobr">$SPEC/tools/bin/turboblaster-m68k/description</span> with
the following contents</p>

<pre>
For TurboBlaster v2.1+ systems running on M68010
                             hardware.
                             Built on TurboBlaster v2.0 with GCC 1.81.
</pre>

<p>A user using a TurboBlaster system when running install.sh would see in the list of toolset choices, something that looks
approximately like</p>

<pre>
turboblaster-m68k            For TurboBlaster v2.1+ systems running on M68010
                             hardware.
                             Built on TurboBlaster v2.0 with GCC 1.81.
</pre>

<p>There are plenty of examples on the install media in <span class="ttnobr">tools/bin/*/description</span>.</p>

<h3 id="presentation">4.a. Toolset presentation</h3>

<p>If the toolset you're building isn't the only one that will work on a particular system, you may want to adjust where in the
list of toolsets it appears, or even whether it appears at all.  By default toolsets are presented in lexical ASCII order. However,
it is possible to both adjust the position of a toolset in the list of candidates, as well as keeping it from appearing at all.</p>

<p>Let's assume that the TurboBlaster systems mentioned in the <a href="#describe">last section</a> have migrated to PowerPC and
have an emulation layer so that they can run old M68K binaries.  Given two toolsets called
<span class="ttnobr">turboblaster-m68k</span> and <span class="ttnobr">turboblaster-ppc</span>, normally the
<span class="ttnobr">turboblaster-m68k</span> would be presented and attempted first.  And the emulation layer is so good that it
would work, but it'd be slower than it needs to be.</p>

<h4 id="exclusion">4.a.1. Excluding otherwise valid candidates</h4>

<p>There are several files that can be used to prevent <span class="ttnobr">install.sh</span> from even attempting to use a
toolset.  The exclusion is silent, and for all intents and purposes makes the affected toolset behave just as one from another OS
or architecture &mdash; it doesn't even show up on the candidate list.</p>

<p>To effect this exclusion, <span class="ttnobr">install.sh</span> looks for signatures of the current system in files in each
toolset's directory.  A toolset is excluded from consideration if any of the following are true:</p>

<table>
<tr> <th>Output from...</th> <th>Appears in...</th> </tr>
<tr> <td><span class="ttnobr">uname -m</span></td> <td><span class="ttnobr">tools/bin/&lt;archname&gt;/excludearch</span></td> </tr>
<tr> <td><span class="ttnobr">uname -s</span></td> <td><span class="ttnobr">tools/bin/&lt;archname&gt;/excludearch</span></td> </tr>
<tr> <td><span class="ttnobr">uname -r</span></td> <td><span class="ttnobr">tools/bin/&lt;archname&gt;/excluderev</span></td> </tr>
<tr> <td><span class="ttnobr">uname -p</span></td> <td><span class="ttnobr">tools/bin/&lt;archname&gt;/excludeproc</span></td> </tr>
</table>

<p>On a PPC-based TurboBlaster system, <span class="ttnobr">uname -m</span> returns "PowerPC".  Putting "PowerPC" into
<span class="ttnobr">tools/bin/turboblaster-m68k/excludearch</span> would ensure that TurboBlaster/PPC users never even saw the
TurboBlaster/M68K tools.</p>

<p>This is most useful for preventing cross-OS confusion.  FreeBSD, for example, used to try to execute Solaris binaries.  Putting
"FreeBSD" (the output from <span class="ttnobr">uname -s</span> on a FreeBSD system) into
<span class="ttnobr">tools/bin/solaris-x86/excludearch</span> fixed that problem and kept the unmaskable and alarming failure
messages from appearing during installation.</p>

<h4 id="order">4.a.2. Affecting presentation order</h4>

<p>In the case where there may be two equally valid toolsets (as might be the case when there's a 32-bit and 64-bit build for the
same OS), it's possible to change the order in which they're presented.  Each toolset has a file named
<span class="ttnobr">order</span> in its directory.  If it doesn't exist, <span class="ttnobr">packagetools</span> will create this
file with contents that are simply:</p>

<pre>
1:&lt;archname&gt;
</pre>

<p>(See the <a href="#package">packagetools</a> section for guidelines on picking <span class="ttnobr">&lt;archname&gt;</span>.)  The
"priority" of a toolset decreases as that number increases.  Continuing with the TurboBlaster example, if we wanted the PowerPC
toolset to be preferred, we'd put</p>

<pre>
2:turboblaster-m68k
</pre>

<p>into <span class="ttnobr">tools/bin/turboblaster-m68k/order</span>.  That would ensure that
<span class="ttnobr">turboblaster-ppc</span> would appear first in the menu, as the number in its <span class="ttnobr">order</span>
file is "1".  Since it appears first in the menu, it's installed before <span class="ttnobr">turboblaster-m68k</span>.</p>

<h2 id="package">5. Packagetools</h2>

<p>If everything has succeeded, and you intend to submit results using your new tools, you should submit the tools to SPEC.
To do so:</p>

<pre>
     cd $SPEC (Unix) or cd %SPEC% (Windows)
     packagetools &lt;archname&gt;
</pre>

<p>Pick an architecture name that other users will recognize.  Check on the install media in tools/bin for some examples.</p>

<p>The packagetools script will create: </p>
<pre>
    $SPEC/tools/bin/&lt;archname&gt;/specxz
    $SPEC/tools/bin/&lt;archname&gt;/spectar
    $SPEC/tools/bin/&lt;archname&gt;/specmd5sum
    $SPEC/tools/bin/&lt;archname&gt;/tools-&lt;archname&gt;.tar.xz
</pre>

<p>Having created a large tarfile with everything in it, <tt>packagetools</tt> will then proceed to create an even larger
tarfile with <tt>specxz</tt> and <tt>spectar</tt> it in too.  This even bigger file is known as:</p>

<pre>
    $SPEC/&lt;archname&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.tar
</pre>

<p>and is to be submitted to SPEC. (See also the example below.)</p>

<p>You can optionally add components to your platform's toolset.  For example, if you would like <span
class="ttnobr">$SPEC/config/default.cfg</span> to be set in an appropriate way, you can add the relative path to default.cfg
as a parameter to packagetools:</p>

<pre>
(on non-Windows systems)
     cd $SPEC
     packagetools &lt;archname&gt; config/default.cfg
</pre>

<p>More than one file may be specified in this way.</p>

<p>Operation on Windows is substantially similar; just provide the relative paths with backslashes instead of forward slashes.</p>

<p>Please submit the resulting tarfile to SPEC for review, along with the recording of your tool build session.
SPEC will review your tools, and assuming that they pass review, will add the tools you have built to its patch library, for
possible distribution to future users of your interesting new architecture.</p>

<p>NOTE 1: If your operating system is unable to execute the packagetools script, please have a look at what the script does
and enter the corresponding commands by hand.  Again, you will need to submit the results to SPEC.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: Be sure to test your packaged tools on a different system, preferably one with a different disk layout.  If the
destination system is unable to invoke <tt>libperl.so,</tt> check that <tt>libperl.so</tt> exists in one of the locations
where <tt>shrc</tt> expects to find it.</p>

<h3 id="PackageExample">5.a. Example: use packagetools</h3>

<p>Here is an example use of <span class="ttnobr">packagetools</span>.  In the example below, notice that:</p>
<ul>
<li>At lines 1-3, we start by verifying that the correct environment has been set.</li>
<li>At line 7, a decription is provided for the toolset.</li>
<li>SPEC will want the log, and verification that 
<span class="ttnobr">runspec -V</span> and <span class="ttnobr">runspec --test</span> 
are working.  At lines 11 to 13, these are created.</li>
<li>At line 15, the <span class="ttnobr">packagetools</span> command is entered.  Since SPEC will want the other three files,
for convenience, they have been added to packagetools. </li> 
<li><b>Note</b> that basic sanity checking of a toolset <a href="#PackageTestExample">also requires</a> demonstration of
<span class="ttnobr">runspec -V</span> and <span class="ttnobr">runspec --test</span> on a second system, as shown in the

<h3 id="PackageTestExample">5.b. Example: test the newly packaged tools</h3>

<p>Testing a newly-built toolset on the system where it was built is not enough to ensure basic sanity of the tools.
Test for unintended dependencies by installing on an entirely different system. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>At line 1, below, it is assumed that a SPEC OMP tree exists on the destination system, and that it lacks a SPEC
toolset.</li>
<li>Line 2 uses NFS (<span class="ttnobr">/net</span>) to copy the new tar file from the build system.  Use whatever method

<h2 id="troubleshooting">6. Troubleshooting: What to do if something goes wrong</h2>

<p>If something goes wrong, unfortunately, you're probably just going to have to take it apart and figure out what.  Here are
some hints on how to go about doing that.</p>

<h3 id="hand">6.a. Try it by hand</h3>

<p>If something goes wrong, you probably do NOT want to make some random adjustment (like: reinstall a compiler, fix an
environment variable, or adjust your path) and start all over again.  That's going to be painful and take a lot of your time.
Instead, you should temporarily abandon the <tt>buildtools</tt> script at that point and just try to build the offending
tool, until you understand exactly why that particular tool is failing.</p>

<p>Consider turning on verbose diagnostics if your system has a way to do that.  Make a huge terminal window (e.g. 200
columns wide by 84 lines tall, with 9999 lines recorded off the top), so you can see what is going on.</p>

<p>Read what <tt>buildtools</tt> (or <tt>buildtools.bat</tt>) does for you, then cd to <span
class="ttnobr">tools/src/&lt;tool&gt;</span> and try the commands by hand. For example, you might do something like this:</p>
<pre>
    cd $SPEC/tools/src/&lt;toolname&gt;
    ./configure
    make (or build.sh or whatever you note buildtools would have done)
</pre>

<p>Now, try fixing that environment variable or reinstalling that compiler, and rebuild the single tool.  Does it look
better?</p>

<p>If not, have a close look at the error messages and the <tt>Makefile</tt>.  Does the <tt>Makefile</tt> use a feature that
is not present in your version of <tt>make</tt>?  If so, can you get it to work with <tt>GNU make</tt>?  </p>


<p>Note that for GNU configure based tools (everything except Perl and its modules) you may specify your compiler by setting
the <tt>CC</tt> environment variable. For compiler flags, set <tt>CFLAGS</tt>.</p>

<p>When building <tt>perl</tt>, note that:</p>

<ul>
 <li> If you want to force the compiler use <tt>-Dcc=yourcompiler</tt></li>
 <li> If you want to force a compiler option use <tt>-Doptimize=youroption.</tt>  If you
   have more than one option to use, do

<pre>
       -Doptimize=-option1 -Aoptimize=-option2 -Aoptimize=option3 ...
</pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Many of the build logs in <span class="ttnobr">tools/src/buildtools.log</span> have examples of
settings used for <tt>PERLFLAGS</tt>.</p>

<p>If you want to see more about what buildtools is doing for you, turn on your shell's verbose mode.  For example:</p>
<pre>
   sh -x ./buildtools
</pre>

<h3 id="known">6.b. Known problems</h3>

<p>Try doing a web search to see if there are known problems with the tool on your architecture.</p>

<p>If SPEC supplies Version X.Y of a tool and it just won't build on your operating system, you might check whether there is
a new Version X.Y+1 available.  If so, download the new version to a scratch directory outside of the SPEC tree and try
building it there.  If that version succeeds, try to deduce why.  Narrow it down to a one-line fix, won't you please?  Then
tell SPEC that you'd like the same one-line fix applied to its variant of the tool.  Or, if you just can't narrow the fix
down, ask SPEC whether it will approve use of Version X.Y+1 instead of X.Y on your system.</p>

<h3 id="justpart">6.c. Executing just part of buildtools</h3>

<p>Once you believe that you understand how to fix the problem tool, and
can build it by hand, see whether the <tt>buildtools</tt> script can build it.
You can execute just a portion of <tt>buildtools</tt> by defining environment
variables.  Please read the script itself to see what variables are
allowed; the following are just some examples:</p>
<pre>
  SKIPALL      - turns off everything.  If you like, set this, then
                   turn individual phases on by setting them.
  DOTOOLSRM    - Remove previously installed tools
  DOCLEAN      - Run 'make clean', 'make distclean', and
                   'make realclean' in all source directories.
  DOMAKE       - build make
  DOXZ         - build xz
  DOTAR        - build tar
  DOMD5        - build specmd5sum
  DOSPECINVOKE - build specinvoke
  DORXP        - build rxp
  DOEXPAT      - build the expat XML parser, used by XML::SAX::ExpatXS
  DOPERL       - build perl
  DOPERL2      - build perl modules
  DOCOPY       - copy the results to $SPEC/bin and fix shbangs
</pre>

<p>It doesn't matter what you set the environment variables to -- any non-zero-length string will do.  In all cases,
"<tt>DO</tt>" can be replaced with "<tt>SKIP</tt>" to reverse the sense of the setting.</p>

<p>If you are using Windows, be sure to note the <span class="alarm">WARNING</span> in <tt>buildtools.bat</tt> about how the
variables work.</p>

<p>If you can now build the (formerly misbehaving) tool using just part of <tt>buildtools</tt>, then you can try building the
whole set (i.e. a build of all tools from start to finish).  It should work now, so be sure to <a href="#logit">turn on your
logging facility</a>.</p>
