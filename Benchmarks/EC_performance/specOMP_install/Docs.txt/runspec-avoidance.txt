   Note: links to SPEC OMP2012 documents on this web page assume that you are
   reading the page from a directory that also contains the other SPEC
   OMP2012 documents. If by some chance you are reading this web page from a
   location where the links do not work, try accessing the referenced
   documents at one of the following locations:

     * www.spec.org/omp2012/Docs/
     * The $SPEC/Docs/ (Unix) or %SPEC%\Docs\ (Microsoft Windows) directory
       on a system where SPEC OMP2012 has been installed.
     * The Docs/ directory on your SPEC OMP2012 distribution media.

Introduction

   This document is for those who prefer to avoid using some of the
   SPEC-supplied tools, typically because of a need for more direct access to
   the benchmarks. For example:

     * Some users want to work directly with benchmark source code and
       compile by hand, rather than through the SPEC supplied tools. Perhaps
       an experimental compiler is under development, and it is more
       convenient to just issue "cc" commands in a sandbox. Perhaps a custom
       build process is needed in order to add instrumentation.

     * Some users want to run the benchmarks directly from the command line,
       rather than via the SPEC supplied tools. Perhaps this is part of a
       debugging effort, or is needed in order to collect a performance
       "trace".

   If the above describes you, here is a suggested path which should lead
   quickly to your desired state. This document shows you how to use SPEC's
   tools for the minimal purpose of just generating work directories, for use
   as a private sandbox. Note, however, that you cannot do formal,
   "reportable" runs without using SPEC's toolset.

Environments

   Three different environments are referenced in this document, using these
   labels:

     * "Unified": The SPEC toolset, the compilers, and the run environment
       are all on the same system.

     * "Cross compile": The SPEC toolset and the compilers are on one system;
       the run time environment is a different system.

     * "Triple": The SPEC toolset is on one system, the compiler is on a
       second, and the run time environment is a third.

Steps

    1. Review two rules: Please read just one page from runrules.html, namely
       "4.5 Research and Academic usage of OMP2012" and "4.4 Required
       Disclosures"

       These run rules sections acknowledge that the suite may be used in
       ways other than the formal environment that the tools help to enforce;
       but they warn that if you plan to publish your results, you should be
       able to state HOW your usage of the suite differs from the standard
       usage.

       So even if you skip over the tools and the run rules today, you should
       plan a time to come back and learn them later.

    2. Install: Get through a successful installation, even if it is on a
       different system than the one that you care about. Yes, we are about
       to teach you how to mostly bypass the tools, but there will still be
       some minimal use. So you need a working toolset and a valid
       installation. If you have troubles with the install procedures
       described in install-guide-unix.html or install-guide-windows.html,
       please see techsupport.html and we'll try to help you.

    3. Pick a benchmark: Pick a benchmark that will be your starting point.

       Choose one benchmark from the OMP2012 suite that you'd like to start
       with. For example, you might start with 363.swim (Fortran) or
       359.botsspar (C). These are two of the shortest benchmarks for lines
       of code, and therefore relatively easy to understand.

    4. Pick a config file: Pick a config file for an environment that
       resembles your environment. You'll find a variety of config files in
       the directory $SPEC/config/ on Unix systems, or %SPEC%\config\ on
       Windows, or at www.spec.org/omp2012 with the submitted OMP2012
       results. Don't worry if the config file you pick doesn't exactly match
       your environment; you're just looking for a somewhat reasonable
       starting point.

    5. Fake it: Execute a "fake" run to set up run directories, including a
       build directory for source code, for the benchmark.

       For example, let's suppose that you want to work with 363.swim and
       your environment is at least partially similar to the environment
       described in the comments for
       $SPEC/config/example-sgi-linux-x86_64-intel.cfg

       [Other Unix-like systems should behave similarly to the example in
       this section.]

       For example, you could enter the following commands:

   % sh
       ... if you're not already in a Bourne-compatible shell
   $ cd  /myspecdisk/tools/omp2012/
       ... or wherever you installed the SPEC OMP2012 tree
   $ . ./shrc      (that's dot-space-dot-slash-shrc)*
   $ cd config
   $ cp example-sgi-linux-x86_64-intel.cfg my_test.cfg
   $ go          (to the $SPEC directory)

   $ runspec --fake --loose --size test --threads 16 --tune base --config my_test swim

       This command should report a success for the build, run and validation
       phases of the test case, but the actual commands have not been run. It
       is only a report of what would be run according to the config file
       that you have supplied.

    6. Find the log: Near the bottom of the output from the previous step,
       notice the location of the log file for this run. The log file
       contains a record of the commands as reported by the "fake" run. You
       can find the commands by searching for "%%".

    7. Find the build dir: To find the build directory that was set up in the
       fake run go to the build directory for that benchmark. For example:,

   $ cd $SPEC/benchspec/OMP2012/363.swim/build  ( or 'go 363 build' )
   $ ls -ltd *build*

       The above command prints the names of each build subdirectory, with
       the most recent first. (On Windows, the analogous comamnd would use
       reversed slashes, and "$SPEC" is spelt "%SPEC%". Instead of "ls -ltd",
       you would say something like "dir build*/o:d".) If this is your first
       time here, there will be only one directory listed, e.g.
       build_base_sgi-x86_64.0000

       You can work in this build directory, make source code changes, and
       try other build commands without affecting the original sources.

    8. Copy the build dir (triple only): If you are using a unified or
       cross-compile environment, you can skip to the next step. But if you
       are using a triple environment, then you will want to package up the
       build directory with a program such as tar -- a handy copy is in the
       bin directory of your SPEC installation, as spectar. Then, you will
       move the package off to whatever system has compilers.

       For example, you might say something like this:

   $ spectar -cvf  -  build_base_sgi-x86_64.0000 | specxz > mybuild.tar.xz
   $ ftp
   ftp> op buildsys
   Connected to buildsys
   Name: whoever
   Password:
   ftp> bin
   ftp> put mybuild.tar.xz

       Note that the above example assumes that you have versions of xz and
       tar available on the system that has compilers, which you will use to
       unpack the compressed tarfile, typically with something like this:

       xz -dc mybuild.tar.xz | tar -xvf -

    9. Build it: Generate an executable using the build directory. If you are
       using a unified or cross-compile environment, then you can say
       commands such as these:

   $ cd build_base_sgi-x86_64.0000
         ...assuming only one such build directory
   $ specmake clean
         ...only if there is a previous build
   $ specmake
   ifort -c -o swim.o -O3 -xSSE4.2 -openmp -mcmodel=medium -shared-intel swim.f
   ...

       You can also carry out a dry run of the build, which will display the
       build commands without attempting to run them, by adding -n to the
       specmake command line. You might find it useful to capture the output
       of specmake -n to a file, so it can easily be edited, and used as a
       script.

       Re-build with (for example) different optimization flags:

   $ vi Makefile.spec
         ...edit the values of the FOPTIMIZE and perhaps EXTRA_LDFLAGS variables
   $ specmake clean
   $ specmake
   ifort -c -o swim.o -O3 -xSSE4.2 -ipo1 -openmp -mcmodel=medium -shared-intel swim.f

   ...

       If you are trying to debug a new system, you can prototype changes to
       Makefile.spec or even to the benchmark sources.

       If you are using a triple environment, then presumably it's because
       you don't have specmake working on the system where the compiler
       resides. But fear not: specmake is just GNU make under another name,
       so whatever make you have handy on the target system might work fine
       with the above commands. If not, then you'll need to extract the build
       commands from the log and try them on the system that has the
       compilers.

   10. Figure out the correct name for the binary: Once you have built an
       executable image, figure out its new name. You can either rename it
       now, in the build directory; or you can do so when you copy it to the
       run directory (next step). The new name will need to be of the form:

       <exename>_<tuning>.<extension>

       where:

          * exename is typically the same as the name of the benchmark, but
            not always. The precise string can be found by saying
                grep exename
            $SPEC/benchspec/OMP2012/nnn.benchmark/Spec/object.pm
            (On Windows, of course, you would spell "$SPEC" as "%SPEC%", turn
            the slashes around, and use findstr)
          * tuning is either base or peak
          * extension is the extension specified in your config file.

       For example, if you are working with 363.swim and your config file has
       the line

       ext=sgi-x86_64

       you would rename your executable to swim_base.sgi-x86_64

   11. Place the binary in the run dir: Using techniques similar to those
       used to find the build directory, find the run directory established
       above, and place the binary into it. If you are using a unified or
       cross-compile environment, you can copy the binary directly into the
       run directory; if you are using a triple environment, then you'll have
       to retrieve the binary from the compilation system using whatever
       program (such as ftp) you use to communicate between systems.

       In a unified environment, the commands might look something like this:

   $ go swim run
   $ ls -td run*
   run_base_test_sgi-x86_64.0000
   $ cd run_base_test_sgi-x86_64.0000
   $ cp ../build_base_sgi-x86_64.0000/swim_base.sgi-x86_64  .

   12. Copy the run dir: If you are using a unified environment, you can skip
       this step. Otherwise, you'll need to package up the run directory and
       transport it to the system where you want to run the benchmark. For
       example:

   $ cd $SPEC/benchspec/OMP2012/363.swim/run
   $ spectar cvf  -  run_base_test_sgi-x86_64.0000 | specxz > myrun.tar.xz
   $ ftp
   ftp> op runsys
   Connected to runsys
   Name: whoever
   Password:
   ftp> bin
   ftp> put myrun.tar.xz

       Note that the above example assumes that you have versions of bzip2
       and tar available on the run time system, which you will use to unpack
       the compressed tarfile, typically with something like this:

       xz -dc myrun.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -

   13. Run it: If you are using a unified environment, you are now ready to
       try "specinvoke":

   $ specinvoke -n
         ... shows the command line that executes the benchmark, in this example

 # specinvoke r6392
 #  Invoked as: specinvoke -n
 # timer ticks over every 1000 ns
 # Use another -n on the command line to see chdir commands and env dump
 # Starting run for copy #0
 dplace -x2 ../run_base_test_sgi_x86.0000/swim_base.sgi-x86_64 < swim.in > swim.out 2>> swim.err

   $ specinvoke -h
         ... explains other options to specinvoke, including '-i #'
             for running multiple iterations
   $ specinvoke
         ... executes that command line

       If you are using a cross-compile or triple environment, then you won't
       be able to use specinvoke. Instead, you'll need to extract the run
       commands from the log and enter them by hand.

   14. Save your work: Important: if you are at all interested in saving your
       work, move the run/build* and run/run* directories to some safer
       location. That way, your work areas will not be accidentally deleted
       the next time someone comes along and uses one of runspec cleanup
       actions..

   15. Repeat: Admittedly, the large number of steps that it took to get here
       may seem like a lot of trouble. But that's why you started with a
       simple benchmark and the simplest workload (--size test in the fake
       step). Now that you've got the pattern down, it is hoped that it will
       be straightforward to repeat the process for the other available
       workloads: --size=train and --size=ref, and then for additional
       benchmarks.

       But if you're finding it tedious... then maybe this is an opportunity
       to sell you on the notion of using runspec after all, which automates
       all this tedium. If the reason you came here was because runspec
       doesn't work on your brand-new environment, then perhaps you'll want
       to try to get it built, using the hints in tools-build.html.

Validation

   Note that this document has only discussed getting the benchmarks built
   and running. Presumably at some point you'd like to know whether your
   system got the correct answer. At that point, you can use specdiff, which
   is explained in utility.html.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   * dot-space-dot-slash-shrc is the safe way to type it. If you use
   Linux/bash, or if you have the current directory in your path, you can
   probably type ". shrc" (dot-space-shrc) with no problems.
