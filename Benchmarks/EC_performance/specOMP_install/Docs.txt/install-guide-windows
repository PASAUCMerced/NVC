   OMP2012 documents. If by some chance you are reading this web page from a
   location where the links do not work, try accessing the referenced
   documents at one of the following locations:

     * www.spec.org/omp2012/Docs/

       installed.
     * The \Docs directory on your SPEC OMP2012 distribution DVD.

Introduction

   The SPEC OMP2012 suite has been tested under Unix and Linux. It has not
   been tested on Mac OS X and Windows systems. Because of shared tools with
   SPEC CPU benchmarks, it should be possible to install the benchmark on Mac
   OS X and Windows systems. Your DVD can be installed under many operating
   systems.

   Reminder: the SPEC license allows you to install on multiple systems as
   you may wish within your institution; but you may not share the software
   with the public.

   This document covers the installation procedure for SPEC OMP2012 under
   Microsoft Windows. Many of the benchmarks require than 4 GB of memory, so
   you need to use an operating system which allows more than 32-bits of
   address space.

   Note: Unless otherwise specified, refererences to "Windows" in this
   document apply to Windows XP or later.

Installation Steps

   This section describes the installing OMP2012 under Microsoft Windows
   step-by-step. The steps are described in some detail here, with brief
   examples. A longer example, from a complete installation, is in the next
   section.

  1. Review Pre-Requisities

   Review the hardware and software requirements, in system-requirements.html

   In particular, please notice in the requirements document that SPEC does
   not recommend installation under Windows/Unix compatibility environments.
   SPEC recommends that such products be removed from your path.

   The steps that follow assume that your DVD drive is on the same system as
   where you wish to install. If it is on a different system, please see
   Appendix 1.

  2. Open a Command Prompt Window

   Open a Command Prompt window (formerly known as an "MSDOS Window").
   Typically, this is done by selecting:
   Start-->All Programs-->Accessories-->Command Prompt.

   Adjust the properties to allow you to see plenty of lines scrolled off the
   top (for example, 9000). Click the upper left corner of the Command Prompt
   window, scroll down to "Properties", click the "Layout" tab, and in the
   section labeled "Screen Buffer Size" enter a new value for "Height".

  3. Pick destination. Have enough space, avoid space.

   Decide where you want to install the OMP2012 suite. You should make sure
   that your chosen destination disk has at least 8GB free. (For more
   information on disk usage, see system-requirements.html.) For the
   following examples, we will assume that your destination is on drive C:,
   in the directory \omp2012.

   Please make sure that there are no spaces in the path. Installing to a
   location that includes a directory or subdirectory named something like
   "My Benchmarks" is asking for trouble. Even if you make it through the
   installation, there may be other programs from SPEC (or from your
   compiler) that expect space to be an argument delimiter, not part of a
   path name, and which therefore fail with odd and hard to understand error
   messges.

  4. Insert the DVD

   If you haven't already done so, insert the DVD, and observe where it is
   mounted. (For example, on Windows 7, if you press Start -> Computer, a
   window comes up that includes "Devices with Removable Storage", where you
   can see the assigned drive letter.) Change your directory to the DVD. For
   the following examples, we'll assume that your DVD is mounted on drive D:,
   so entering just the letter and a colon gets us to that drive:

 C:\> D:
 D:\>

  5. Run install.bat

   You're now ready to run the installer. The format for this command is

   install.bat destination_drive:\destination_directory

   For example, if your DVD is in drive D:, and you want to install OMP2012
   on drive C: in a folder named omp2012, you could type:

   D:\> install.bat  C:\omp2012

   You should see a message similar to the following:

 D:\>install.bat c:\omp2012
 Installing FROM source: D:\

   If the source is NOT correct, hit Control-C and
   run install.bat from the correct benchmark tree.

 Press any key to continue . . .

   If you see a message similar to the above, just press return. If you see
   error messages, check to be sure that you are in the correct directory and
   that %temp% is defined (see below).

   Next, the install procedure will ask you to confirm the destination
   folder.

   You should see a message similar to the following:

 Installing TO destination: "c:\omp2012"

    If the destination is NOT correct, hit Control-C and
    specify the desired installation path as a parameter.
    For example:

    D:\install.bat  D:\SPEC\omp2012

 Press any key to continue . . .

   If you see a message similar to the above, just press return, and the
   installation begins.

   As it proceeds, the install procedure will inform you that the benchmarks
   are being unpacked. Please be patient - although only a few messages are
   printed, thousands of files are installed:

 Installing from "D:\"
 Installing to "c:\omp2012\"



  Depending on the speed of the drive holding your installation media
  and the speed of your destination disk, this may take more than 5 minutes.
  Please be patient.

 .
 .     (lines omitted)
 .
 Testing the tools installation (this may take a minute)

 Runspec tests completed successfully!
 Installation completed!

 c:\omp2012>

   The installation will consume around 1.5GB on your destination disk.

   After this step completes, you will find yourself in the destination
   directory that you selected.

  6. Edit shrc.bat

   Read the comments in the file

   shrc.bat

   and make the appropriate edits for your compiler paths.

   Caution: you may find that the lines are not correctly formatted (the text
   appears to be all run together) when you edit this file. If so, see the
   section below: About Text Files and Windows/Unix Compatibility.

   You will have to uncomment one of two lines:

 rem set SHRC_PRECOMPILED=yes

   or

 rem set SHRC_COMPILER_PATH_SET=yes

   by removing "rem" from the beginning of the desired line.

   If you uncomment the first line, you must have pre-compiled binaries for
   the benchmarks

   If you uncomment the second line, you will have to follow the instructions
   (a few lines below further along in shrc.bat) to set up the environment
   for your compiler, either (A) by calling a vendor-supplied batch setup
   file or (B) by entering the path yourself:

    1. It is usually better to call a vendor-supplied batch setup file,
       because the file may set additional needed variables, such as INCLUDE
       and LIB. Examples of vendor files, such as iclvars, vcvars, and
       vsvars, are in the comments within shrc.bat. Do not assume that any of
       those examples will work on your system: you need to check first. The
       names and locations of these files change from compiler to compiler,
       from version to version, and even from system to system (if you choose
       a non-default installation directory).

    2. If you enter a path directly:

          * Be sure to set all needed variables. Check your compiler
            documentation.
          * Be sure that you do not have any semi-colons (;) inside of
            quotes, as that may cause mysterious errors.

   No matter how your path gets set, in general it is a good idea to
   understand what is in your path, and that you have only what you truly
   need. If you have non-standard versions of commonly used utilities in your
   path, you may avoid unpleasant surprises by taking them out. By default,
   shrc.bat will print the path after it is done. If you would prefer that it
   not do so, you can set SHRC_QUIET=yes in your environment.

  7. Use your shrc.bat

   Set the environment, using your edited shrc. For example:

   C:\omp2012> shrc.bat

   From this point forward, we are testing basic abilities of the OMP2012
   kit, including compiling benchmarks and running them. You may skip the
   remaining steps if all of the following are true:

    1. You are confident that the previous steps have gone smoothly.
    2. You will not be compiling the benchmarks.
    3. Someone else has given you pre-compiled binaries.

   Warning: even if someone else supplies binaries, you remain responsible
   for compliance with SPEC's Fair Use rule and the OMP2012 run rules.

  8. Pick a config file to start with. Modify as needed.

   SPEC benchmarks are supplied as source code. They need to be compiled,
   under the control of a "config file". Example config files can be found in
   %SPEC%\config. For an introduction to config files, see "About Config
   Files" in runspec.html.

   For example, on a Windows system with the Intel C++ compiler installed, a
   user might do something similar to the following:

   C:\omp2012> cd %SPEC%\config
   C:\omp2012> copy Example-windows-x64-icl.cfg mine.cfg

   Although an Example config file on the kit can help you get started, you
   still need to look at it and understand at least the basics of what it is
   doing for you. The following paragraphs walk through using the above
   config file on a particular System Under Test (SUT). Your SUT will
   probably differ, but a similar config file analysis will be useful.

   This example config file says at the top:

 #      Operating system version:    Windows 7 (64-bit)
 #      Compiler name/version:       Intel Compiler 12  , MS VS 2008
 #      Other software:              SmartHeap library

   The user notices that the example SUT has only two of the four software
   items mentioned above:

     * The example SUT does have Windows 7 (64-bit). If the example config
       file were used on other versions of Windows, it might or might not
       work.
     * The example SUT has Intel Compiler 12. Therefore, the syntax for
       compiler switches in this example should be useful on this system.
     * The example SUT does not have Microsoft Visual Studio 2008
       (abbreviated MS VS 2008 above). It has Visual Studio 10. Therefore,
       after looking up the compiler documentation, the tester edits the
       config file to change:
           -Qvc9
       to
           -Qvc10
     * The example SUT does not have SmartHeap. Therefore, following the
       instructions in the example config file, the user removes the
       reference to:
           shlW32M.lib

  9. Build a benchmark

   Now that you have edited your config file, try building a benchmark:

   C:\omp2012> runspec --action=build --tune=base ^
   More? --config=mine.cfg 350.md

   (In the examples, "^" (often called "hat" or "carat") indicates line
   continuation.)

   The --tune=base indicates that we want to use only the simple tuning, if
   the config file contains more than one kind of tuning.

  10. Run one benchmark with the test dataset

   Test that you can run a benchmark, using the minimal input set - the
   "test" workload.

   C:\omp2012> runspec --size=test --iterations=1 --noreportable ^
   More? --tune=base --config=mine.cfg 350.md

   The --noreportable ensures that the tools will allow us to run just a
   single benchmark instead of the whole suite.

  11. Try a real dataset

   Test that you can run a benchmark using the real input set - the
   "reference" workload. For example:

   C:\omp2012> runspec --size=ref --iterations=1 --noreportable ^
   More? --tune=base --config=mine.cfg 350.md

  12. Try a full (reportable) run

   If everything has worked up to this point, you may wish to start a full
   run, perhaps leaving your computer to run overnight. The extended test
   will demand significant resources from your machine, including
   computational power and memory of several types. In order to avoid
   surprises, before starting the reportable run, you should review the
   section About Resources, in system-requirements.html.

   To run a reportable test with simple (baseline) tuning:

   C:\omp2012> runspec --tune=base --threads=12 --config=mine.cfg gross

   Please have a look at runspec.html to learn more about using runspec.

Complete Example Installation

   Here is a complete SPEC OMP2012 Windows installation, with commentary. We
   assume that Steps 1 through 4 are already done: pre-requisites have been
   reviewed, a command window is open, we have enough space, and the DVD is
   mounted - this time, on drive F:.

   Step 5: change to the drive where the DVD is mounted, and start the
   installation


 C:\>f:

 F:\> install.bat C:\omp2012
 Installing FROM source: F:\

   If the source is NOT correct, hit Control-C and
   run install.bat from the correct benchmark tree.

 Press any key to continue . . .

 Installing TO destination: "C:\omp2012"

    If the destination is NOT correct, hit Control-C and
    specify the desired installation path as a parameter.
    For example:

    F:\install.bat  D:\SPEC\omp2012

 Press any key to continue . . .


 Installing from "F:\"
 Installing to "C:\omp2012\"



  Depending on the speed of the drive holding your installation media
  and the speed of your destination disk, this may take more than 5 minutes.

   Step 8. Modify a config file. Below, the tester has made similar edits to
   the ones described above, with the addition that the line ext = has been
   modified. The ext line tags the binary with an extension. If you change
   this line when you change tuning, you can keep multiple binaries around,
   perhaps to compare them and analyze them.

 C:\omp2012> cd %SPEC%\config

 C:\omp2012\config> copy Example-windows-ia32-icl.cfg jul13a.cfg
         1 file(s) copied.

   Step 9. Use runspec to build one benchmark:

   At this point, we have demonstrated basic correct installation of both the
   benchmark and the compiler, by verifying that a benchmark can be compiled
   under the control of runspec.

   Step 10. Now try running that benchmark, using the minimal test workload.
   The test workload runs in a tiny amount of time and does a minimal
   verification that the benchmark executable can at least start up:

   Notice about 19 lines up where it says "Success: 1x350.md". That is what
   we want to see.

   Step 11. Let's try running 350.md with the real ("ref") workload. This is
   going to take a while.

   of the 14 benchmarks.

   Notice that the values for SPECompG_base2006 and SPECompG_peak2006 are
   "--" and "Not Run"; these would be filled in if we did a "reportable" run;
   for information, please see "--reportable" in runspec.html

   There are also dashes or dummy values for several parts of the system
   description, both at the top of the page and in the section that follows.
   These dashes indicate that we have not filled in the fields that describe

Appendix 1: the DVD drive is on system A, but I want to install on system B.
What do I do?

   If the title of this section describes your situation, you basically have
   two choices.

    1. Network mount: You can mount the device over the network and do the
       installation remotely.
    2. Tar file: You can install from the tar file

  Appendix 1.a. Network mount

   You might be able to mount the DVD on one system and use network services
   to make it available on other systems.

   Please note that the SPEC OMP2012 license agreement does not allow you to
   post the DVD on any public server. If your institution has a SPEC OMP2012
   license, then it's fine to post it on an internal server that is
   accessible only to members of your institution.

   Whether you attempt a network mount will probably depend on:

     * available network hardware,
     * the networking services provided by your operating system, and
     * the security policies of your IT department (if any).

   If your network environment allows easy cross-system mounting, you can use
   a network mount for the installation. Otherwise, you can fall back on the
   tar file.

   Note: if you insert the DVD on a system running Unix or Linux, you may
   need to share it using nfs commands. This Windows installation guide does
   not attempt to give hints about how to do Unix nfs commands, although you
   will find some hints in the corresponding appendix of
   install-guide-unix.html. Instead, let's assume that you are using two
   Windows systems. System A is a Windows system with a DVD drive; System B
   is a Windows system where you would like to do the installation.

   To do the installation:

    1. At System A, insert the DVD.

    2. Then, bring up a Windows Explorer window (for example, by double
       clicking on the My Documents icon). Click the plus sign next to My
       Computer and you should see the DVD drive. Let's suppose that it is
       drive F:.

    3. Right-click on the DVD drive and select "Sharing and Security..."

    4. In the box that comes up, under the "Sharing" tab, you may see a
       warning To protect your computer from unauthorized access, sharing the
       root of a dive is not recommended. If you understand the risk but
       still want to share the root of the drive, click here. This most
       informative warning is displayed for your consideration and you can
       proceed to consider it. If you decide that it is safe to share your
       DVD drive, then click where indicated.

    5. Select "Share this folder"

    6. Now, move to System B.

    7. Bring up a Windows Explorer window (for example, by double clicking on
       the My Documents icon). Select Tools -> Map Network Drive. The Drive
       letter may offer a default, such as Z:. In the box for Folder, type
       two backslashes, the name of system A, a backslash, and its shared
       drive letter - for example \\SystemA\F

    8. Continue with Step 2 above. When you get to Steps 5 and 6, remember to
       use the drive letter as it is known on System B - from the dialog box
       of a moment ago - for example

 D:\Documents and Settings\Saturos\> Z:
 Z:\> install.bat  C:\omp2012


  Appendix 1.b. Tar file

   If the DVD drive is on a system other than the one where you wish to do
   the installation, and if you do not wish to try to get a network mount
   working, then the final fallback is to use the compressed tarfile. If you
   choose this option, please carefully observe the warnings.

    1. Go to the system with the DVD drive ("System A"). Insert the SPEC
       OMP2012 DVD.

    2. From a command window (aka terminal window), cd to the top level
       directory on the DVD.

    3. You are going to retrieve five things from the DVD. First, find the
       large tarfile and its corresponding md5 file:

 cd install_archives
 dir omp2012.tar.xz*

       or, if System A is a Unix system, then:

 cd install_archives
 ls -l omp2012.tar.xz*

       In either case, you should see one moderately large file > 200MB,
       omp2012.tar.xz, and a small file associated with it that contains a
       checksum, omp2012.tar.xz.md5.

       If you don't see the above files, try looking for cpu*tar*. The name
       might change if, for example, a maintenance update of OMP2012 changes
       the name slightly to indicate an updated version.

       Do whatever is required in order to transfer both files intact to the
       system where you wish to do the installation ("System B"). If you use
       ftp, do not forget to use image (binary) mode. For example:

 ftp> bin   <-------- important
 200 Type set to I.
 ftp> put omp2012.tar.xz
 ftp> put omp2012.tar.xz.md5

       Please note that the SPEC OMP2012 license agreement does not allow you
       to post the above file on any public ftp server. If your institution
       has a SPEC OMP2012 license, then it's fine to post it on an internal
       server that is accessible only to members of your institution.

    4. Next, you are going to retrieve specxz.exe, specmd5sum.exe, and
       spectar.exe from the DVD.

       Please do not use Windows Zip utilities, as these will not preserve
       line endings and will cause difficult-to-diagnose benchmark
       miscompares.

       Please do not use other tar utilities, as these may not handle long
       path names. Many commonly-supplied tar utilities cannnot.

       If you have GNU tar and the genuine xz, then you can use those;
       otherwise, look around on the DVD to find the SPEC-supplied versions,
       like so:

 F:\> cd tools

 F:\tools> cd bin

       Once you've found these versions of specxz.exe, specmd5sum.exe, and
       spectar.exe, transfer them to system B using the same methods that you
       used for the big tarfile.

    5. On system B, use specmd5sum to check that the file transfer worked
       correctly. In this example, we assume that you have placed all 5 of
       the files mentioned above in the \kits\ directory on drive C::

 C:\kits\> specmd5sum -c omp2012.tar.xz.md5
 omp2012.tar.xz: OK

    6. Pick a disk with 8GB free, go there, and unpack the tarfile, like so:

 C:\kits\> H:
 H:\> mkdir omp2012
 H:\> cd omp2012
 H:\omp2012\> C:\kits\specxz -d C:\kits\omp2012.tar.xz
 H:\omp2012\> C:\kits\spectar -xf C:\kits\omp2012.tar

       Be patient: it will take bit of time to unpack! It might take 15
       minutes, depending on the speed of your processor and disks. Go for a
       coffee break.

    7. Now, type install, without any arguments afterwards. That is, unlike
       the instructions in step 6 above, you do not need to mention a device
       or directory if you are installing from the tarfile. You will see
       output similar, though not identical, to that shown in the example
       installation -- the messages about Unpacking xxxx are not printed,
       because you already did the unpacking with your spectar command.

    8. Continue with step 6, editing the shrc.bat file, above.

Appendix 2:  Uninstalling SPEC OMP2012

   At this time, SPEC does not provide an uninstall utility for SPEC OMP2012.
   Confusingly, there is a file named uninstall.sh in the top directory, but
   it does not remove the whole product; it only removes the SPEC tool set,
   and does not affect the benchmarks (which consume the bulk of the disk
   space).

   To remove SPEC OMP2012 on Windows systems, select the top directory in
   Windows Explorer and delete it.

   To remove SPEC OMP2012 on Unix systems, use rm -Rf on the directory where
   you installed the suite, for example:

   rm -Rf /home/cs3000/saturos/spec/omp2012

   If you have been using the output_root feature, you will have to track
   those down separately. Therefore, prior to removing the tree,, you might
   want to look for mentions of output root, for example:

 Windows:
     cd %SPEC%\config
     findstr output_root *cfg

 Unix:
     cd $SPEC/config
     grep output_root *cfg

   Note: instead of deleting the entire directory tree, some users find it
   useful to keep the config and result subdirectories, while deleting
   everything else.

Appendix 3: Useful Tips and Techniques

  Appendix 3.a.  About Temporary Space (%temp)

   It has occasionally been reported that installation attempts fail if there
   is not a directory that can be used to hold temporary files. To check this
   point, print the %temp% environment variable, and try writing a small file
   to it, like this:

 C:\Users\kumar> echo %temp%
 C:\Users\kumar\AppData\Local\Temp

 C:\Users\kumar> echo "hi" > %temp%\test-hi.txt

 C:\Users\kumar> type %temp%\test-hi.txt
 "hi"

 C:\Users\kumar> del %temp%\test-hi.txt

   If %temp% is not set, the first echo command above will just print:
       %temp%
   If %temp% is set to a directory that is not writeable, the second command
   will print:
       Access is denied
   If either of these happen, you should set it to the full path (with drive
   letter) of a directory that can be used as scratch space. For example, if
   Kumaran would like to use a temporary directory underneath his directory
   on drive K:, he could type:

   C:\> set temp=K:\KUMARAN\TEMP

  Appendix 3.b. About Text Files and Windows/Unix Compatibility

   There are many files in the SPEC OMP2012 kit that contain text.
   Unfortunately, Unix systems and Windows systems have different conventions
   for storing text files. Sometimes, a text file formatted for Windows will
   appear on Unix as if it has extra Control-M characters. Sometimes, a text
   file formatted for Unix will appear on Windows as if all the lines were
   joined together.

   There are at least three ways for Windows users to correctly view and edit
   text files that originated on a Unix system:

    1. Use WordPad. WordPad can commonly be found by
       Start-->All Programs-->Accessories-->WordPad

    2. Use the MS-DOS Editor. Open a Command Prompt and type "Edit". This
       alternative does not work on 64-bit Windows systems. The program only
       recognizes files with 8 characters or fewer, a dot, and then 3
       characters or fewer. If you are trying to use it with a longer file
       name, you can discover that there is an "8 dot 3" synonym for it by
       typing: "dir /x".

    3. Use the editor "vi". Although vi originated on Unix systems, there are
       also Windows versions. "UNIX Compatibility" products for Windows often
       include a version of vi, and there are independently-distributed
       versions, such as "Vi IMproved" (at http://www.vim.org/).

   Note that SPEC does not "endorse" any of these solutions, although it is
   hoped that at least one of them will be useful for you.
