   Appendix 2: Uninstalling SPEC OMP2012

   Note: links to SPEC OMP2012 documents on this web page assume that you are
   reading the page from a directory that also contains the other SPEC
   OMP2012 documents. If by some chance you are reading this web page from a
   location where the links do not work, try accessing the referenced
   documents at one of the following locations:

     * www.spec.org/omp2012/Docs/
     * The $SPEC/Docs/ (Unix) or %SPEC%\Docs\ (Windows) directory on a system
       where SPEC OMP2012 has been installed.
     * The Docs/ directory on your SPEC OMP2012 distribution.

Installation Steps

   The SPEC OMP2012 suite has been tested under Unix and Linux. The benchmark
   environment should work with Mac OS X and Windows systems but has not been
   tested. Your benchmark can be installed under many operating systems.

   Reminder: the SPEC license allows you to install on multiple systems as
   you may wish within your institution; but you may not share the software
   with the public.

   The installation procedure for Unix, Linux, and Mac OS X is as follows:

  1. Review Pre-requisites

   Review the hardware and software requirements, in system-requirements.html

  2. Create destination. Have enough space, avoid space.

   Create a directory on the destination disk. You should make sure that you
   have a disk that has at least 8GB free. (For more information on disk
   usage, see system-requirements.html.)

   Don't put spaces in the path: even if you make it through the installation
   (doubtful), you are just asking for trouble, because there may be multiple
   programs from both SPEC and from your compiler that expect space to be an
   argument delimiter, not part of a path name. (This being the *Unix*
   install guide, you wouldn't have thought of using spaces in in the first
   place, would you?)

  3. Mount the Benchmark ISO

   You can either burn a DVD of the benchmark ISO file, or you can just
   directly mount the benchmark ISO file you have downloaded. If you choose
   to mount the benchmark ISO file, the following examples may help you get
   it mounted. The examples assume the benchmark has been save in the file
   omp2012-1.0.iso. The target location listed in these examples is /mnt but
   could be anything you have created.

   +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |AIX:    |loopmount -i omp2012-1.0.iso -o "-V cdrfs -o ro" -m /mnt|
   |--------+--------------------------------------------------------|
   |Linux:  |mount -t iso9660 -o ro,loop omp2012-1.0.iso /mnt        |
   |--------+--------------------------------------------------------|
   |Solaris:|mount -F hsfs -o ro `lofiadm -a omp2012-1.0.iso` /mnt   |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------+

   After you are done installing, you may want to unmount the benchmark ISO.
   This can be done by making sure you are no longer in the install mount
   point and then issue the comman umount /mnt. This will unmount the
   filesystem. If you are on Solaris, you may also want to remove the lofi
   device that was created with lofiadm command. See the man page for further
   instructions.

   If you have created a DVD, insert the the DVD, and, if necessary, issue a
   mount command for it. For many operating systems, the DVD will be
   automatically mounted. If not, you may have to enter an explicit mount
   command. If your operating system supports the Rock Ridge Interchange
   Protocol extensions to ISO 9660, be sure to select them, unless they are
   the default. The following examples are not intended to be comprehensive,
   but may get you started or at least give you clues which manpages to read:

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |AIX:            |mount -v cdrfs -r /dev/cd0 /cdrom                      |
   |----------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
   |HP-UX:          |mount -o cdcase /dev/disk/disk5 /mnt/cdrom/            |
   |----------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
   |Linux:          |mount -t iso9660 -o ro,exec /dev/cdrom /mnt            |
   |----------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
   |Solaris:        |If Volume Management is running, you should find that  |
   |                |the DVD is automatically mounted, as                   |
   |                |/cdrom/label_of_volume/ If not, you should be able to  |
   |                |mount it with commands similar to this:                |
   |                |mkdir /mnt1                                            |
   |                |mount -F hsfs -o ro /dev/dsk/c0t6d0s0 /mnt1            |
   |----------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
   |Virtual Machines|If you are running in a virtual machine, you will need |
   |                |to convince the host operating system to allow your    |
   |                |guest OS to have access to the DVD. The means of       |
   |                |accomplishing this will vary. For reference, the       |
   |                |following worked with a Linux guest running under      |
   |                |Virtual Box V4.0.6, with Windows 7 as the host:        |
   |                |(1) Shut down the virtual machine (don't just pause it;|
   |                |tell it to run its shutdown procedure). (2) The        |
   |                |Settings dialog should now be visible (it's grayed out |
   |                |if the machine state is not shut down). (3) Use        |
   |                |Settings to configure the DVD drive as both available  |
   |                |to the guest OS and as "passthrough". (4) Boot the     |
   |                |virtual machine. (5) Log in. (6) Insert the DVD. (7) At|
   |                |this point, the DVD was automatically mounted as       |
   |                |/media/SPEC_OMP2012.                                   |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Note that you may need root privileges to mount the DVD or benchmark ISO.

   The following paragraphs assume that your DVD drive is on the same system
   as where you wish to install. If it is on a different system, please see
   Appendix 1.

  4. Set your directory to the Benchmark ISO

   If you haven't already done so by now, start a Terminal window (aka
   "command window", "shell", "console", "terminal emulator", "character cell
   window", "xterm", etc.) and issue a cd command to set your current working
   directory to the directory where the DVD is mounted. The exact command
   will vary depending on the label on the media, the operating system, and
   the devices configured. It might look something like one of these:

 $ cd /Volumes/SPEC_OMP2012
 $ cd /media/SPEC_OMP2012
 $ cd /dvdrom/spec_omp2012
 $ cd /mnt

  5. Use install.sh

   Type:

 ./install.sh

   q. Do you have to be root? Occasionally, users of Unix systems have asked
   whether it is necessary to elevate privileges, or to become 'root', prior
   to entering the above command. SPEC recommends (*) that you do not become
   root, because: (1) To the best of SPEC's knowledge, no component of SPEC
   OMP needs to modify system directories, nor does any component need to
   call privileged system interfaces. (2) Therefore, if you find that it
   appears that there is some reason why you need to be root, the cause is
   likely to be outside the SPEC toolset - for example, disk protections, or
   quota limits. (3) For safe benchmarking, it is better to avoid being root,
   for the same reason that it is a good idea to wear seat belts in a car:
   accidents happen, humans make mistakes. For example, if you accidentally
   type:

   kill 1

   when you meant to say:

   kill %1

   then you will very grateful if you are not privileged at that moment.

   (*) This is only a recommendation, not a requirement nor a rule.

    5.a. Destination selection

   Depending on your installation type, you may be prompted for a destination
   directory:

 SPEC OMP2012 Installation
 Top of the OMP2012 tree is '/Volumes/SPEC_OMP2012'
 Enter the directory you wish to install to (e.g. /usr/omp2012)
 /Users/kgoel/omp2012


   When answering the above question, note that you will have to use syntax
   acceptable to sh (so you might need to say something like "$HOME/mydir"
   instead of "~/mydir"). As mentioned above, don't use spaces.

   Note: You can also specify the destination directory in the command line,
   using the -d flag, for example, like this:
   ./install.sh -d /Users/kgoel/omp2012

   The installation procedure will show you the directories that will be used
   to install from and to. You will see a message such as this one:

 Installing FROM /Volumes/SPEC_OMP2012
 Installing TO /Users/kgoel/omp2012

 Is this correct? (Please enter 'yes' or 'no')
 yes

   Enter "yes" if the directories match your expectations. If there is an
   error, enter "no", and the procedure will exit, and you can try again,
   possibly using the -d flag mentioned in the note above.

    5.b. Toolset selection

   The installation procedure will attempt to automatically determine your
   current platform type (hardware architecture, operating system, etc.) In
   some cases, the tools may identify several candidate matches for your
   architecture.

   You typically do not have to worry about whether the toolset is an exact
   match to your current environment, because the toolset selection does not
   affect your benchmark scores, and because the installation procedure does
   a series of tests to ensure that the selected tools work on your system.

   Examples: (1) the installation procedure may determine that SPEC tools
   built on version "N" of your operating system are entirely functional on
   version "N+3". (2) Tools built on one Linux distribution often work
   correctly on another: notably, certain versions of SuSE are compatible,
   from a tools point of view, with certain versions of RedHat. (3) Tools
   built on AMD chips with 64-bit instructions ("amd64") are compatible with
   Intel chips that implement the same instruction set under the names
   "EM64T" or "Intel 64" (but not compatibie with chips that implement the
   Itanium instruction set, abbreviated "ia64"). (4) Often, though not
   always, 32-bit toolsets work correctly on 64-bit operating systems.

   Mostly, you don't need to worry about all this, because the installation
   procedure does a comprehensive set of tests to verify compatibility.

   If at least one candidate match is found, you will see a message such as:

 The following toolset is expected to work on your platform.  If the
 automatically installed one does not work, please re-run install.sh and
 exclude that toolset using the '-e' switch.

 The toolset selected will not affect your benchmark scores.

 macosx                        For MacOS X 10.4+ on Intel systems.
                               Built on MacOS X 10.6.6 with GCC 4.0.1, using
                               the 10.4u SDK.

   If the installation procedure is unable to determine your system
   architecture, you will see a message such as:

 We do not appear to have vendor supplied binaries for your
 architecture.  You will have to compile the tool binaries by
 yourself.  Please read the file

     /Volumes/SPEC_OMP2012/Docs/tools_build.html

 for instructions on how you might be able to build them.

   If you see that message, please stop here, and examine the file
   tools-build.html.

   Note: If the tools that are automatically installed on your system do not
   work, but you know that another set of tools that is in the list will
   work, you can exclude the ones that do not work. You may be instructed to
   do this during the first installation. Use the -e flag for install.sh, for
   example:

   ./install.sh -e linux-redhat72-ia32

   The above will cause the tools for linux-redhat72-ia32 to be excluded from
   consideration.

   Alternatively, you can explicitly direct which toolset is to be used with
   the -u flag for install.sh, for example:

   ./install.sh -u linux-suse10-amd64

   The above will cause the tools for linux-suse10-amd64 to be installed,
   even if another toolset would have been chosen automatically. If you
   specify tools that do not work on your system, the installation procedure
   will stop without installing any tools.

    5.c. The files are unpacked and tested

   Thousands of files will be unpacked from the distribution media, and
   quietly installed on your destination disk. (If you would prefer to see
   them all named you can set VERBOSE=1 in your environment before installing
   the kit.) Various tests will be performed to verify that the files have
   been correctly installed, and that the tools work correctly. You should
   see summary messages such as these:

 =================================================================
 Attempting to install the the macosx toolset... <<-- or whatever toolset was selected

 Checksums are all okay.

 Installation successful.  Source the shrc or cshrc in
 /Users/kgoel/omp2012                          <<-- your directory
 to set up your environment for the benchmark.


   At this point, you will have consumed about 1.5GB of disk space on the
   destination drive.

  6. Source shrc or cshrc

   Change your current directory to the top-level SPEC directory and source
   either shrc or cshrc:

     * For example, if you are using a Bourne-compatible shell (such as ash,
       bash, ksh, zsh), you could type:

       Users$ cd /Users/kgoel/omp2012/
       omp2012$ . ./shrc         <-- that's dot-space-dot-slash-shrc
     * If you are using a csh-compatible shell, you could type:

       Users% cd /Users/kgoel/omp2012
       omp2012% source cshrc

   The effect of the above commands is to set up environment variables and
   paths for SPEC.

   From this point forward, we are testing basic abilities of the SPEC
   OMP2012 kit, including compiling benchmarks and running them. You may skip
   the remaining steps if all of the following are true:

    1. You are confident that the previous steps have gone smoothly.
    2. You will not be compiling the benchmarks.
    3. Someone else has given you pre-compiled binaries.

   Warning: even if someone else supplies binaries, you remain responsible
   for compliance with SPEC's Fair Use rule and the OMP2012 run rules.

  7. Try to build one benchmark

   Change to the config directory, and test that you can build a benchmark
   using a config file supplied for your system. For example:

 $ cd $SPEC/config
 $ cp Example-macosx-gcc421.cfg Khushboo-macosx.cfg
 $ runspec --config=Khushboo-macosx.cfg --action=build --tune=base md

   The above command assumes that you can identify a config file (in the
   directory $SPEC/config) that is appropriate for you. In this case, the
   user started with Example-macosx-gcc421.cfg. Your starting point will
   probably differ; here are some resources to help:

     * Hints about picking Linux config files are included in the long
       example below.
     * For a quick introduction to config files, see "About Config Files" in
       runspec.html
     * You may need to copy one of the supplied config files, and edit it for
       your system.
     * For example, you may need to edit it to have the correct path to your
       compiler!

   The "--tune=base" above indicates that we want to use only the simple
   tuning, if more than one kind of tuning is supplied in the config file.

  8. Try running one benchmark with the test dataset

   Test that you can run a benchmark, using the minimal input set - the
   "test" workload. For example:

 $ runspec --config=Khushboo-macosx.cfg --size=test --noreportable --tune=base \
 --iterations=1 --threads=12 md

   The "\" above indicates that the command is continued on the next line.
   The "--noreportable" ensures that the tools will allow us to run just a
   single benchmark instead of the whole suite, "--iterations=1" says just
   run the benchmark once, and "--threads=12" says to use twelve OpenMP
   threads .

   Check the results in $SPEC/result

  9. Try a real dataset

   Test that you can run a benchmark using the real input set - the
   "reference" workload. For example:

 $ runspec --config=Khushboo-macosx.cfg --size=ref \
      --noreportable --tune=base --iterations=1 --threads=12 md

   Check the results in $SPEC/result.

  10. Try a full (reportable) run

   If everything has worked up to this point, you may wish to start a full
   run, perhaps leaving your computer to run overnight. The extended test
   will demand significant resources from your machine, including
   computational power and memory of several types. In order to avoid
   surprises, before starting the reportable run, you should review the
   section About Resources, in system-requirements.html.

   Have a look at runspec.html to learn how to do a full run of the suite.

   The command runspec -h will give you a brief summary of the many options
   for runspec.

   To run a reportable run of the benchmark with simple (baseline) tuning:

   C:\omp2012> runspec --tune=base --config=Khushboo-macosx.cfg --threads=12
   gross

Example Installation

   Here is a complete Linux installation, with interspersed commentary. This
   example follows the steps listed above. We assume that Steps 1 through 3
   are already complete (the pre-requisites are met, we have enough space,
   the benchmark ISO is mounted).

   Step 4: Set the current working directory to the benchmark mount location:

 $ cd /media/SPEC_OMP2012


   Step 5: Invoke install.sh. When prompted, we enter the destination
   directory:

 $ ./install.sh

 SPEC OMP2012 Installation

 Top of the OMP2012 tree is '/media/SPEC_OMP2012'
 Enter the directory you wish to install to (e.g. /usr/omp2012)
 /omp2012

 Installing FROM /media/SPEC_OMP2012
 Installing TO /omp2012

 Is this correct? (Please enter 'yes' or 'no')
 yes

 The following toolset is expected to work on your platform.  If the
 automatically installed one does not work, please re-run install.sh and
 exclude that toolset using the '-e' switch.

 The toolset selected will not affect your benchmark scores.

                               SuSE Linux 10 or later, and other
                               compatible Linux distributions, including
                               some versions of RedHat Enterprise Linux
                               and Oracle Linux Server.

 Installation successful.  Source the shrc or cshrc in

 to set up your environment for the benchmark.


   Step 6: Now, we change the current working directory from the install
   media to the location of the new SPEC OMP2012 tree. Since this user has a
   a Bourne compatible shell, shrc is sourced (for csh compatible shells, use
   cshrc).

   Next, the config file Example-linux64-amd64-gcc43+.cfg has been picked as
   a starting point for this system. The gcc compiler might not provide the
   best possible score for this particular SUT (System Under Test), a server
   with two Intel XEon X5690 processors, but this config file provides a
   reasonable start in order to demonstrate that the SPEC tree is functional.

   (Note that the term "amd64" in the config file name does not designate a
   chip from a particular manufacturer; rather, it designates an instruction
   set, variously known as "amd64", "EM64T", and "x86_64". The config file is
   an OK starting point for this SUT.)

   Just above, various compile and link commands may or may not be echoed to
   your screen, depending on the settings in your config file. At this point,
   we've accomplished a lot. The SPEC tree is installed, and we have verified
   that a benchmark can be compiled using the Fortran compiler. (The
   sharp-eyed reader may notice some warnings above about casts of pointers.
   These warnings from the compiler have been reviewed by SPEC's project
   leader for 350.md, who has determined that they will not affect operation
   of the benchmark.)

   Step 8: Now try running a benchmark, using the minimal test workload. The
   test workload runs in a tiny amount of time and does a minimal
   verification that the benchmark executable can at least start up:

   Step 9: let's try running md with the real workload. This will take a
   while on the tested server running Linux.

   Success with the real workload! So now let's look in the result directory
   and see what we find:

 $ cd result
 $ ls

 OMP2012.003.log:runspec: runspec --config=mytest.cfg --size=ref --noreportable --tune=base --iterations=1 --threads=12 md
 $

   Notice the three separate sets of files: .001, .002, and .003

   OMP2012.001.log has the log from the compile.

   OMP2012.002.log has the log from running 350.md with the "test" input. The
   various outputs (.csv, .html, .rsf, .txt), and a compiler flags report
   (.flags.html), are all preceded by "OMPG2012", because 350.md is one of
   the gross benchmarks. The tools also distinguish whether the input was a
   "test" input by putting that in the file name as well.

   OMP2012.003.log has the log from running 350.md with the "ref" input. Once
   again, the various outputs and the configuration file (.cfg) all start
   with OMPG2012.

   Here is the complete .txt report from running 350.md ref:

 Tested with SPEC OMP2012 v21.
 Report generated on Fri Aug 17 12:10:34 2012 by OMP2012 ASCII formatter v1765.


   Done. The suite is installed, and we can run at least one benchmark for
   real (see the report of the time spent in 350.md above).

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Appendix 1: the DVD drive is on system A, but I want to install on system B.
What do I do?

   If the title of this section describes your situation, you basically have
   two choices.

    1. Network mount: You can mount the device over the network and do the
       installation remotely.
    2. Tar file: You can install from the tar file

  1. Network mount

   You might be able to mount the DVD on one system and use network services
   to make it available on other systems.

   Please note that the SPEC OMP2012 license agreement does not allow you to
   post the DVD on any public server. If your institution has a SPEC OMP2012
   license, then it's fine to post it on an internal server that is
   accessible only to members of your institution.

   Whether you attempt a network mount will probably depend on:

     * available network hardware,
     * the networking services provided by your operating system, and
     * the security policies of your IT department (if any).

   If your network environment allows easy cross-system mounting, or if you
   feel brave about reading manpages, you can use a network mount for the
   installation. Otherwise, you can fall back on the tar file.

   Network mount, easy:
   for example, System A Solaris/Opteron  +  System B Solaris/SPARC

   Your operating system may be configured to automatically mount the drive
   and automatically make it visible to other network systems, or may make it
   visible with minimal user intervention. During one set of testing, system
   A (with the DVD drive) was an Opteron-based system running Solaris 10. The
   SPEC OMP2012 DVD was inserted. The operating system mounted it
   automatically, and from a terminal window, a (non-privileged) user entered
   the Solaris

   share

   command to make it visible to other hosts.

   On System B, a Solaris SPARC system, a non-privileged user typed:

 cd /net/systemA/cdrom/spec_omp2012
 ./install.sh

   and the installation proceeded normally, picking up from step 5, above.

   Network mount, medium difficulty:
   for example, System A Solaris/Opteron  +  System B Tru64 Unix/Alpha

   Subsequent to the tests of the previous paragraphs, the DVD drive on
   System A (Solaris/Opteron) was also visible to a system running Compaq
   Tru64 UNIX V5.1A. But in this case, a little assistance was needed from
   the privileged (root) account on system B:

 echo "systemA.domain.com:/cdrom/spec_omp2012 /systemA nfs ro,bg,soft 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
 mkdir /systemA
 /usr/sbin/mount /systemA

   Then, the non-privileged user was able to say:

 cd /systemA
 ./install.sh

   and once again the installation proceeded normally, picking up from step
   5, above.

   Network mount, a bit harder:
   for example, System A SuSE/x86  +  System B Mac OS X/PowerPC

   The SPEC OMP2012 DVD was also inserted into a system running SuSE Linux
   9.0, and used from a Mac OS X PowerBook. On both these systems, there are
   probably automatic tools that would have accomplished the following more
   quickly, but the tester happened to read the manpages in the particular
   order that he happened to read them in. The following succeeded:

   On System A, root added

 /dev/cdrom  /cd  iso9660  ro,user,noauto,unhide

   to /etc/fstab as suggested by man mount; the DVD was inserted; and the
   user typed mount /cd. On System A, root also added:

 /cd  192.168.0.0/24(ro,insecure,no_root_squash,sync)

   to /etc/exports, and then typed:

 exportfs -r
 rpc.nfsd -p 8
 rpc.mountd
 cat /var/lib/nfs/etab

   On System B, root typed:

 mkdir /remote
 mount -t nfs 192.168.0.106:/cd /remote

   Finally, the user typed

 cd /remote
 ./install.sh

   and installation continued as normal, with step 5.

  2. Tar file

   If the DVD drive is on a system other than the one where you wish to do
   the installation, and if you do not wish to try to get a network mount
   working, then the final fallback is to use the compressed tarfile. If you
   choose this option, please carefully observe the warnings.

    1. Go to the system with the DVD drive ("System A"). Insert the SPEC
       OMP2012 DVD, and, if required, issue a mount command.

    2. From a terminal window (aka command window), cd to the top level
       directory on the DVD.

    3. You are going to retrieve five things from the DVD. First, find the
       large tarfile and its corresponding md5 file:

 cd install_archives
 ls -l omp2012.tar.xz*

       or, if System A is a Windows system, then:

 cd install_archives
 dir omp2012.tar.xz*

       In either case, you should see one moderately large file > 500MB,
       omp2012.tar.xz, and a small file associated with it that contains a
       checksum, omp2012.tar.xz.md5.

       If you don't see the above files, try looking for cpu*tar*. The name
       might change if, for example, a maintenance update of SPEC OMP2012
       changes the name slightly to indicate an updated version.

       Do whatever is required in order to transfer both files intact to the
       system where you wish to do the installation ("System B"). If you use
       ftp, do not forget to use image (binary) mode. For example:

 $ ftp
 ftp> op systemB
 Name: imauser
 Password:
 ftp> cd /kits
 ftp> bin   <-------- important
 200 Type set to I.
 ftp> put omp2012.tar.xz
 ftp> put omp2012.tar.xz.md5

       Please note that the SPEC OMP2012 license agreement does not allow you
       to post the above file on any public ftp server. If your institution
       has a SPEC OMP2012 license, then it's fine to post it on an internal
       server that is accessible only to members of your institution.

    4. Next, you are going to look on the DVD for versions of specxz,
       specmd5sum, and spectar that are compatible with system B. Please do
       not use the tar supplied by your operating system unless you are sure
       that it can handle long path names. Many commonly-supplied tar
       utilities cannnot.

       Please do not use Windows Zip utilities, as these will not preserve
       line endings.

       If you have GNU tar and the genuine xz, then you can use those;
       otherwise, please hunt around on the DVD to find prebuilt versions
       that are compatible with your environment, like so:

 $ cd /media/SPEC_OMP2012/
 $ cd tools/bin
 $ ls
 aix5L-ppc64          linux-redhat72-ia32  macosx         solaris10-sparc
 hpux11iv3-ipf        linux-rhas4r4-ia64   solaris-sparc  solaris10-x86
 linux-debian6-armv6  linux-suse10-amd64   solaris-x86    windows-i386
 $ cd aix5L-ppc64
 $ cat description
 For PowerPC systems running AIX 5L V5.3 or later
                               Built on AIX 5L 5300-02 with the
                               IBM XL C/C++ for AIX V9.0.0.25 compiler
 $ ls -g spec*
 -r-xr-xr-x. 1 imauser  52635 Aug 19  2011 specmd5sum
 -r-xr-xr-x. 1 imauser 594483 Aug 19  2011 spectar
 -r-xr-xr-x. 1 imauser 250543 Aug 19  2011 specxz
 $

       Once you've found the right versions of specxz, specmd5sum, and
       spectar for the system where you intend to install (system B),
       transfer them to system B using the same methods that you used for the
       big tarfile.

    5. On system B, use specmd5sum to check that the file transfer worked
       correctly. In this example, we assume that you have placed all 5 of
       the files mentioned above in the /kits directory:

 $ cd /kits
 $ chmod +x spec*
 $ specmd5sum -c omp2012.tar.xz.md5
 omp2012.tar.xz: OK

    6. Unpack the tarfile, like so:

 $ cd /mybigdisk
 $ mkdir omp2012
 $ cd omp2012
 $ /kits/specxz -dc /kits/omp2012.tar.xz | /kits/spectar -xf -

       Be patient: it will take a bit of time to unpack! It might take 15
       minutes, depending on the speed of your processor and disks. Go for a
       coffee break.

    7. Now, at last, type ./install.sh and pick up with step 5, above. Your
       output will be similar, but not identical, to the output shown in step
       5 above: you won't see the "Unpacking xxxx" messages, because you
       already did the unpacking.

       Note that the directory where you unpack the tarfile will be the
       directory you install FROM and also the directory you install TO. This
       is normal, and expected, for a tarfile installation.

       You will see a question similar to this:

 Installing FROM /mybigdisk/omp2012
 Installing TO /mybigdisk/omp2012

 Is this correct? (Please enter 'yes' or 'no')
 yes

       If you enter "no", installation will stop. If you try to install TO
       another directory, using the -d flag, the installation will not
       succeed when using the tar file method.

Appendix 2:  Uninstalling SPEC OMP2012

   At this time, SPEC does not provide an uninstall utility for SPEC OMP2012.
   Confusingly, there is a file named uninstall.sh in the top directory, but
   it does not remove the whole product; it only removes the SPEC tool set,
   and does not affect the benchmarks (which consume the bulk of the disk
   space).

   To remove SPEC OMP2012 on Windows systems, select the top directory in
   Windows Explorer and delete it.

   To remove SPEC OMP2012 on Unix systems, use rm -Rf on the directory where
   you installed the suite, for example:

   rm -Rf /home/cs3000/saturos/spec/omp2012

   If you have been using the output_root feature, you will have to track
   those down separately. Therefore, prior to removing the tree,, you might
   want to look for mentions of output root, for example:

 Windows:
     cd %SPEC%\config
     findstr output_root *cfg

 Unix:
     cd $SPEC/config
     grep output_root *cfg

   Note: instead of deleting the entire directory tree, some users find it
   useful to keep the config and result subdirectories, while deleting
   everything else.
