Introduction

   This document describes known problems in SPEC OMP2012. The latest version
   of this document may be found at
   http://www.spec.org/omp2012/Docs/errata.html.

   If you are looking for the solution to a technical question, you might
   also want to review the latest version of
   http://www.spec.org/omp2012/Docs/faq.html.

   SPEC OMP2012 is extensively tested on a wide variety of systems prior to
   release, including a variety of Unix and Linux systems; big-endian and
   little-endian systems; 64-bit systems. Nevertheless, as with any software
   product, problems may be found too late in the testing process to be fixed
   in the release, or may be discovered after release.

   If you discover problems that are not listed here or in the FAQ, please
   report them to SPEC.

   About the format of this document:

     * Problems may be added in the Open section from time to time. In each
       case, a workaround is given, if one is known.
     * When problems are fixed, they are moved to the Closed section.

   Notice to maintainers: When updating this document, please do not ever
   re-use problem numbers.
