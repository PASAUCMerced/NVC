if you cannot read HTML, but it is NOT RECOMMENDED.

To read this document in the recommended way, point
your favorite web browser at one of these 3 places:
(1) The SPEC site http://www.spec.org/omp2012/Docs/
(2) The docs directory from your OMP2012 DVD, e.g.:
    /dvdrom/Docs/ for Unix or E:\Docs\ for Windows.
(3) The Docs directory on the system where you have
    installed your SPEC OMP2012 tree - for example:
    /spec/Docs/ (Unix) or D:\myspec\Docs\ (Windows)

Suggested reading order:

   If you are just getting started with SPEC OMP2012, here is a suggested
   reading order:

    1. Start with readme1st.html to get an overview of the suite and the
       process.

    2. Use system-requirements.html to help you choose which computer to use
       as your first test system.

    3. Once you've chosen the test system, install the suite, using
       install-guide-unix.html. Please note that Windows operating system has
       not been tested, but it is possible it will work, see
       install-guide-windows.html for hints on installing on Windows.

    4. Read at least the first part of runspec.html, because runspec is the
       primary tool in the suite. It is used to build the benchmarks, run
       them, and report on their results. You should read at least section 1
       through section 3.1 of that document.

    5. After that, you can pick and choose which documents to read based on
       where your needs may take you. The list in the next section can help
       you decide. Note that the run rules will need to be studied carefully
       if you plan to quote results in public.

List of documents

   The following documents are included with SPEC OMP2012.

   config.html

   SPEC OMP2012 provides benchmarks in source code form, which are compiled
   under control of SPEC's toolset. A config file controls how they are
   compiled, and also controls various settings for your tests. If you are
   new to the suite, you will probably start with an existing config file,
   such as one downloaded from www.spec.org/omp2012. Eventually, you will
   either want to understand the details of what is inside that config file,
   or you will want to write your own. This document tells you how.

   credits.html

   Information about the contributors to SPEC OMP2012.

   errata.html

   Known problems and errata information.

   faq.html

   Frequently asked technical questions

   flag-description.html

   When the benchmarks are compiled, compilation flags (such as -O5 or
   -unroll) are detected and automatically reported by the tools. A flag
   description file helps the tools recognize such flags and describe them in
   reports. The tester is responsible for providing a flag description file
   to go with his or her config file. This document tells you how to write a
   flag description file.

   Note that if you are just getting started with OMP2012, you may find that
   your starter config file already points to a valid flags description, via
   the config file flagsurl field.

   install-guide-unix.html

   How to install SPEC OMP2012 on Unix, Linx, and Mac OS X systems. Includes
   an example installation and an example of running the first benchmark.

   install-guide-windows.html

   How to install SPEC OMP2012 on Microsoft Windows systems. Includes an
   example installation and an example of running the first benchmark.
   Running on Windows is not officially supported.

   legal.html

   Copyright notice and other legal information.

   makevars.html

   Advanced users of the suite who want to understand exactly how the
   benchmarks are built can use this file to help decipher the process.

   monitors.html

   Information about monitoring hooks.

   readme1st.html

   Written in the form of questions and answers, this document provides
   useful background information to the SPEC OMP benchmarks, explains which
   system components are measured, gives a high-level overview of the
   benchmarking steps, summarizes the contents of the SPEC OMP2012 package,
   and details types of metrics available with the suite.

   runrules.html

   The SPEC OMP2012 Run and reporting rules. These must be followed for
   generating publicly disclosed results. If you plan to quote results in
   public, you will need to study these rules carefully.

   runspec.html

   Information on the "runspec" command, which is the primary user interface
   for running SPEC OMP2012 benchmarks and reporting results.

   runspec-avoidance.html

   Some users prefer to avoid using the SPEC-supplied toolset, because they
   have specialized tasks that require more direct access to the benchmarks.
   Such tasks might include instrumenting the code, doing performance traces,
   or debugging an experimental compiler. This document describes how you can
   use SPEC's tools for the minimal purpose of just generating work
   directories, for use as a private sandbox.

   sysinfo

   A SPEC result includes a system description. If your system allows it, you
   may be able to automate part of the process of gathering a system
   description. This perl script provides an example of how that might be
   done. Note: some web browsers may refuse to open a file of type ".pl". If
   clicking on the link doesn't work, try saving the file and opening it with
   your favorite text editor.

   system-requirements.html

   A list of the hardware and software needed in order to run the SPEC
   OMP2012 suite.

   techsupport.html

   Information on SPEC technical support.

   tools-build.html

   How to build (or re-build) the tools such as runspec

   utility.html

   How to use various utilities, such as specinvoke, specdiff, and specmake.
