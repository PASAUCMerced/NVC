meschach (1.2b-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Standardise package names to normal forms libmeschach-dev and
    libmeschach1. Motivated by libc6 2.5 change of long double from
    64 bit to 124 bit, which requires renaming of library packages
    using long double. I think meschach support for long double was not
    fully completed, but using this opportunity to bring the package naming
    in line with usual Debian conventions. Closes: #430316.
  * Put developer's docs into libmeschach-dev not libmeschach1.
  * Standards version 3.7.2.
  * Use debhelper 5 (set in debian/compat).
  * Use `./macheps` not `macheps` in configure.in, likewise for
    `maxint`. Regenerate configure with autoconf.
  * maxint.c: #include <stdio.h> to define printf.

meschach (1.2b-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Explicitly declared m_free ,v_free, px_free as type int (extern)
    in matrix.h.  Required for compiling with C++.  Closes: #254387.
  * Standards version 3.6.1.

meschach (1.2b-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add "Section: devel" to the meschach-dev entry in debian/control so I
    won't get that annoying override warning everytime I upload the package.
    I'll leave the overall Section as "math" for now, although you could
    well argue it belongs in "libs" (cf. blas, lapack).

meschach (1.2b-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed MAXDIM in matrix.h to 10000 instead of 2001, allowing for
    matrices which are 100's of MB in size, rather than only several MB,
    allowing for better use of the capacity of modern machines.
    Done by request of one of my users.  I won't set it to 100000, since
    that would imply matrices tens of GBs in size, which is larger than most
    current PCs' entire memory. If you really need MAXDIM that large,
    recompile the package yourself.
  * Standards version 3.5.8.
  * Use debhelper v4 (just for the hell of it).  i.e. DH_COMPAT=4
  * Cleaned out dh_installinfo, dh_installmanpages from debian/rules.

meschach (1.2b-9) unstable frozen; urgency=low

  * Corrected Section to math from devel in debian/control.
  * Removed dh_testversion from debian/rules (now deprecated).
  * Removed meschach.postinst, used DH_COMPAT=3 to handle ldconfig.
  * Standards version 3.5.6.0.

meschach (1.2b-8) unstable frozen; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (closes: #68320, #68321, #80284).
  * Standards version 3.5.2.0.  The ./debian was regenerated from scratch
    using dh_make to help update to latest standard.  Added -D_REENTRANT to
    CFLAGS as suggested in Policy 11.2
  * Recompiled against latest libraries. 
  * All instances of #include <math.h> moved in front of local
    includes (#include "matrix.h" etc) to avoid redefining HUGE_VAL.
  * Reference to complex.h commented out in configure.in.
    Meschach's complex numbers are not the same as those in <complex.h>,
    which corresponds to the new C99 standard.
  * #DEBHELPER# introduced to postinst scripts, prerm introduced accordingly
    (to help with move from /usr/doc to /use/share/doc).
  * "rm *.so" added to clean and realclean in makefile.in.
