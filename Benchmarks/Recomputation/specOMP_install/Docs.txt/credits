   Creating a suite of source code benchmarks to provide a consistent,
   comparative measure of OpenMP and CPU-intensive performance is not simple.
   The challenges are numerous, for example:

     * locating meaningful programs;
     * ensuring that they port to numerous environments;
     * defining rules to govern how the programs are compiled, run and
       reported;
     * developing a toolset to help enforce these rules while still making
       things easy to use; and
     * defining a process by which decisions can be made amongst the group
       working on the project.

   And in the end, you hope you have something that is fair, relevant, and
   understandable, that will address technology for a period of years.

   Such is the case with SPEC OMP2012, which is an update and replacement for
   OMP2001. The new benchmark suite:

     * Provides a variety of applications and application areas included in
       the suite.
     * Uses application source code that is significantly complex.
     * Tests more features of OpenMP.
     * Provides for the optional collection of power data while running the
       benchmark.
     * Improves the tools for running and using the suite.
     * Clarifies and updates the run rules.
     * Improves documentation.

   All of this is due to the efforts of a large team of people from around
   the world, that SPEC would like to thank (with apologies and thanks to
   those who may not be listed).

  Program Authors and Contributors

   SPEC OMP benchmarks are based on real-world applications and feature
   tests. We therefore thank the authors of those codes.

   Thank you to the many participants of the "SPEC OMP Benchmark Search
   Program" and, in particular, the authors that contributed programs that
   were made part of the suite:

   For more information regarding the SPEC benchmarks, including information
   about other contributors, see the documentation in the individual
   benchmarks directories.

  SPEC

   We would also like to thank:

     * SPEC management, who provided us with resources, and kept the SPEC HPG
       Subcommittee on their toes:

          * Walter Bays - President, SPEC
          * Kaivalya Dixit - Long-time President, and Guiding Light of SPEC
          * Larry Gray - Long-time Treasurer, SPEC

     * The SPEC office, who were the ones who really provided us with the
       resources:

          * Dianne Rice - Administration
          * Cathy Sandifer, Jason Glick - Webmasters
          * Charles McKay - Office
          * Bob Cramblitt - Press Relations

  Benchmark Project Leaders, Analysis, Tools, Testing, and Documentation

   Most importantly, thank you to the people who sweated through technical
   details and porting issues, debated their view points vigorously, and were
   willing to drive issues to conclusion. Without these people this benchmark
   suite would truly not exist.

   Huiyu Feng, Robert Henschel, Huian Li, Matthias Mueller, Chris Parrott,
   Brian Whitney, for being project leads of one or more benchmarks and
   sheperding them into the final suite.

   Huiyu Feng, Daniel Hackenberg, Gabriele Jost, Huian Li, Daniel Molka,
   Chris Parrott, Joe Robichaux, Pavel Shelepugin, Brian Whitney for
   regularly testing out the kits and providing status reports.

   Huiyu Feng, Daniel Molka, Chris Parrott, Joe Robichaux, Brian Whitney for
   help in discovering and fixing key portability issues within indvidiual
   benchmarks.

   John Baron, Huiyu Feng, Brian Whitney, Daniel Hackenberg, Daniel Molka,
   for providing performance data and analysis of the individual benchmarks.

   Daniel Hackenberg and Daniel Molka for taking the lead on power metrics.
   And Gabriele Jost and Brian Whitney for help with the testing.

   Matthijs van Waveren for taking the lead on the run & reporting rules.

   Cloyce Spradling is the primary author of the SPEC OMP2012 toolset and
   Brian Whitney for his translation of SPEC HPG requirements so Cloyce could
   implement them.

   The SPECpower Committee for all their work on power measurements which is
   being made use of in this benchmark suite.

  Behind the scenes

   Finally, we thank all of the people behind the scenes in the compiler
   groups, architecture groups and performance groups who supported their
   work for SPEC at their respective companies.

  The Bottom Line

   The SPEC OMP2001 was a popular suite that lasted more than ten years. We
   hope this suite will take its place and be an equally important
   contribution to the OpenMP community.

   Thank you!

   Kalyan Kumaran, Chair, SPEC HPG Committee
   Mattias Mueller, Vice-Chair, SPEC HPG Subcommittee
   Matthijs Van Waveren, Secretary, SPEC HPG Committee
   Brian Whitney, HPG Release Manager
