   Note: links to SPEC OMP2012 documents on this web page assume that you are
   reading the page from a directory that also contains the other SPEC
   OMP2012 documents. If by some chance you are reading this web page from a
   location where the links do not work, try accessing the referenced
   documents at one of the following locations:

     * www.spec.org/omp2012/Docs/
     * The $SPEC/Docs/ directory on a system where SPEC OMP2012 has been
       installed.
     * The Docs/directory on your SPEC OMP2012 distribution.

I. Hardware and Software Requirements

   To run and install SPEC OMP2012, the following are required.

  A. System/OS:

   You will need a computer system running UNIX, Microsoft Windows, or Mac OS
   X. The benchmark suite includes a toolset. Pre-compiled versions of the
   toolset are provided that are expected to work with:

     * AIX: PowerPC systems running AIX 5L V5.3 or later
     * Linux: The SPEC tools are compatible with many contemporary (year
       2011) Linux distributions for Itanium, PowerPC, and x86, and with many
       older versions. For an exact list of the Linux tool sets, where they
       were built, and their expected compatibility, please see the table
       below.
     * MacOS X 10.4 or later on Intel systems.
     * Solaris: SPARC systems running Solaris 8 or later
     * Solaris: x86 systems running Solaris 9 9/05 or later
     * Windows: Microsoft Windows XP or later on x86 or x86_64 systems

   Please ensure that you meet the minimum required version prior to
   installing SPEC OMP2012 V1.2.

   For systems not listed in above, such as earlier or later versions of the
   above systems, you may find that the tools also work, but SPEC has not
   tested them. Windows systems that are not based on NT, such as Windows 95,
   Windows 98, and Windows ME, will definitely NOT work. Please see the
   Portability Notes below.

   Even though tools are provided for Windows and MacOS, the benchmark is
   unsupported for these systems because there has been no testing done with
   them. The toolsets are provided as a courtesy in case you want to see if
   the benchmark does work on these OS.

   Caution:

     * Unsupported toolsets are provided as a courtesy, as a service to users
       who may have the listed platform(s).
     * Unsupported toolsets have been tested much less extensively than other
       tool sets and might or might not work.
     * More importantly, some of the benchmarks themselves have not been
       ported for the environments represented by the unsupported toolsets:

          * Therefore, if you use an unsupported toolset, you will need to
            dedicate time to a porting effort.
          * Please especially notice that it is impossible to do a reportable
            run on an unsupported system until such time as SPEC approves any
            source changes and/or portability flags needed for such system.
          * For more information about obtaining SPEC approval for source
            changes, see techsupport.html.

    I.A.1. About Linux distributions

   Over time, various mechanisms have evolved on Linux, including libraries,
   32-bit/64-bit support, executable format, linking, and run-time loading.
   These mechanisms have sometimes forked with Linux distributions and then
   occasionally rejoined later. SPEC OMP2012 has been tested with a variety
   of Linux distributions, but the possibility remains that you may encounter
   incompatibilities if you are not using *exactly* the same version as was
   used when the tools were built. Therefore, the table that follows tells
   you exactly what was used.

   If you find that you are unable to install the pre-compiled SPEC OMP2012
   on Linux, and you would like to build the tools yourself, please see the
   notes in tools-build.html. SPEC may be able to provide advice for your
   build, but SPEC does not promise that you will succeed. Please see the
   limitations described in techsuport.html.

                       64-bit AMD64/EM64T Linux systems
                       running SuSE Linux 10 or later,   Built on SuSE Linux
   linux-suse10-amd64  and other compatible Linux        10 with GCC v4.1.0
                       distributions, including some     (SUSE Linux)
                       versions of RedHat Enterprise
                       Linux and Oracle Linux Server.

    I.A.2. SPEC does not recommend use of Windows/Unix compatibility products
    with OMP2012

   SPEC does not recommend installation of OMP2012 on Microsoft Windows under
   Windows/Unix compatibility environments (such as Cygwin, MinGW, MKS, SFU,
   and so forth). The tools and benchmarks have not been ported to such
   environments. Please install from an ordinary command window (formerly
   known as an MS-DOS window).

   If you have a Windows/Unix compatibility product on your Windows computer,
   SPEC recommends that you remove it from your %PATH% prior to installing or
   using SPEC OMP2012. The reason for this recommendation is that providing a
   Unix-like environment on Windows poses difficult problems. Historically
   there have been various approaches, with differing (incompatible)
   assumptions about how to mask or bridge differences between Windows and
   Unix. The SPEC CPU toolset has its own approach and its own set of
   assumptions, and there have been reports of difficult-to-diagnose errors
   when a Windows/Unix compatibility product is present on the path, as
   described in faq.html. As discussed in the faq document, if such problems
   occur, your first step should be to simplify the path, removing the
   compatibility product.

  B. ISO

   The benchmark is provided as an ISO file. If you want, you can put it on a
   DVD, and if you do, you will need a DVD drive or network access to a
   system that has one

  C. Memory

   Typically 28 GB of memory will be required, exclusive of OS/overhead; but
   more may be required:

     * The OMP2012 benchmarks (code + workload) have been designed to fit
       within about 28GB of physical memory.

     * The 28GB of RAM for the benchmarks does not include space needed for
       the operating system and other non-SPEC tasks on the system under
       test.

     * Attempting to run the suite with insufficient memory is strongly
       discouraged, as you will end up measuring the speed of your paging
       file, not the speed of your system running compute intensive
       workloads.

     * More memory may be needed if you run larger thread counts, in that
       additional threads may add to the requirement memory total.

   Warning: When an operating system runs out of memory, errors may occur
   that are difficult to diagnose. See the section on resources, below.

  D. Disk space

     * Typically you will need at least 8GB of disk space to install and run
       the suite. However, space needs can vary greatly depending upon your
       usage and system. The 8GB estimate is based on the following:

         1. Unpacked and installed, the suite takes approximately 1.5 to 2GB
            of disk space.
         2. When compiling your own binaries, the size of the build
            directories and resulting objects will vary depending upon your
            system, compiler, and compiler options. Estimate at least 2 to
            3GB of disk space per build. If you plan to maintain multiple
            sets of binaries, each set will need space.
         3. A single run (using binaries you have built, or using pre built
            binaries from a separate source) takes an additional 2 to 3GB of
            disk space.

     * Minimum requirement: It is possible to run with about 3GB of disk
       space if: you delete the build directories after the build is done;
       and you clean run directories between tests. See the discussion of
       disk space in runspec.html for more information about managing disk
       space.

  E. Compiler, or pre-compiled binaries

   Since SPEC supplies only source code for the benchmarks, you will need
   either:

    1. A set of compilers for the result(s) you intend to measure: All three
       of C99, C++98 and Fortran-95 compilers

       --or--

    2. A pre-compiled set of benchmark executables, given to you by another
       user of the same revision of SPEC OMP2012, and any run-time libraries
       that may be required for those executables.

II. Portability Notes

   SPEC OMP2012 is a source code benchmark, and portability of that source
   code is one of the chief goals of SPEC OMP2012. SPEC has invested
   substantial effort to make the benchmarks portable across a wide variety
   of hardware architectures, operating systems, and compilers.

   Despite SPEC's testing efforts, certain portability problems are likely to
   arise from time to time. For example:

     * Some platforms may not have a Fortran-95 compiler available.

     * Some older compilers may not include all the features needed to run
       the entire suite.

     * Sometimes, a new release of a compiler or operating system may
       introduce new behavior that is incompatible with one of the
       benchmarks.

   If you visit http://www.spec.org/omp2012/ and look up results for SPEC
   OMP2012, you will find combinations of OS and compiler versions that are
   known to work. For example, if a vendor reports a SPEComp2012 result on
   the SuperHero 4 using SuperHero Unix V4.0 with SuperHero C V4.0 and
   SuperHero C++ V4.0, you may take that as an assertion by the vendor that
   the listed versions of Unix, C, and C++ will successfully compile and run
   the SPEC OMPG2012 suite on the listed machine.

   For systems that have not (yet) been reported by vendors, SPEC can provide
   limited technical support to resolve portability issues. See
   techsupport.html for information.

III. About Resources and Mysterious Failures

   Resource Demand: The SPEC OMP2012 benchmarks place a significant load on
   your system. Each benchmark will issues as many threads as you request and
   try to consume 100% of it (perhaps virtual).

   As described above, the nominal memory footprint is just under 32 GB.
   Depending on your operating system architecture, the memory may be of
   various types, including:

     * physical memory,
     * virtual memory, and
     * swap/pagefile reservations (*);
     * process-private heap,
     * process-private stack, and
     * process-private code;
     * operating system memory of similar types when the OS performs tasks on
       behalf of the process.

   (*)You don't want to actually use your pagefile much, as that is a recipe
   for testing your disk instead of testing your CPU. Nevertheless, it is not
   uncommon for operating systems to require that pagefile space be
   "reserved", and benchmarks may fail if reservations are unavailable.

   Mysterious failures: If an OS is unable to satisfy a resource request
   while your benchmarks are running, you may encounter
   difficult-to-diagnose, hard-to-reproduce error messages. Processes may be
   killed by the OS on a (seemingly) random basis, or may fail to start. If
   the OS is feeling sufficiently stressed, error messages may be cryptic or
   even non-existent. You might, or you might not, be able to find additional
   detail about the resource shortages in system locations such as event
   logs, message logs, or console logs.

   Resource Competition: Meanwhile, contemporary systems run many tasks other
   than the benchmarks. Personal systems commonly include processes that
   support the user, which the user may not be aware of:

     * There may be virus/spyware/intrusion defenders, disk defragmenters,
       search indexers, bluetooth and network listeners, license managers,
       software updaters, and nightly backup programs.
     * There may be automated power-saving modes or screen savers that start
       when the user wanders away from the keyboard.
     * The system may be configured:

          * to download the Library of Congress once every 4 days,
          * to check for email once every 4 minutes, and
          * to update a social media newsfeed once every 4 seconds.

   All of the above may affect observed performance, and if you are unlucky,
   may cause hard-to-reproduce resource shortages that prevent you from
   completing benchmark runs. Therefore, you may want to consider reviewing
   the controls for services such as the above, and you may want to reduce
   the load from these services during the benchmark run. When you consider
   adjusting services, please observe these CAUTIONS:

     * CAUTION 1 SPEC does not endorse any particular solution to the
       resource problems discussed in this section. You need to make your own
       decision as to what services and programs are important. If you turn
       off something essential, and your system turns into a mushroom, it is
       not SPEC's fault. Use good judgment about what you choose to disable.

     * CAUTION 2 If you choose to report results in public, you must run your
       system in a manner that is documented and supported. See the run rules
       for details.

   In addition, each of these techniques may improve the probability that the
   benchmarks have a fresh set of dedicated resources:

    1. Start a new terminal window, or
    2. Log out and back in, or
    3. Reboot
