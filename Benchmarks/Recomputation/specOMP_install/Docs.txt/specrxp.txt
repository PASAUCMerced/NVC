NAME

   rxp - XML parser program

SYNOPSIS

   rxp [  -abemnNRsStvVx ] [ -o b|p|0|1|2|3|i|d ] [ U 0|1|2 ] [ -c encoding ]
   [ url ]

DESCRIPTION

   rxp reads and parses XML from the url (or standard input if none is
   provided) and writes it to standard output, optionally expanding entities,
   defaulting attributes, and translating to a different output encoding.

   rxp accepts XML 1.0 and 1.1, and the corresponding versions of XML
   namespaces. It implements the Oasis XML catalog specification.

   Common option combinations are -Nxs to check a document for
   well-formedness and namespace well-formedness, and -VNxs to also check for
   DTD-validity.

OPTIONS

    -a  Insert declared default values for omitted attributes.
    -v  Be verbose.
    -V  Validate the document. Repeating this option will make the program
        treat validity errors as well-formedness errors, and exit after the
        first validity error (otherwise a warning will be printed for each
        one).
    -d  Read the whole DTD (internal and external parts) regardless of any
        standalone declaration. Otherwise a declaration "standalone='yes'"
        will prevent the external part from being read (unless validation is
        selected).
    -N  Enable XML namespace support. The document will be checked for
        correct namespace syntax, and if -b is specified qualified element
        and attribute names will be displayed with their URIs.
    -R  The value of this flag is a time limit in seconds, after which the
        program will abort. This is to protect against denial-of-service
        attacks using malicious documents.
    -S  Keep track of xml:space attributes. This will only affect output when
        -b is specified.
    -e  Obsolete, do not use.
    -E  Do not expand entity references (opposite of old -e flag)
    -s  Be silent (that is, suppress output). Useful for benchmarking or if
        you just want to see the error messages.
    -b  Print output as "bits".
    -n  Treat the input as normalised SGML rather than XML. Not intended for
        general use.
    -o  If this flag is p, output is in the default (plain) format. If it is
        b, output is printed as "bits" (equivalent to -b). If it is 0, output
        is suppressed (equivalent to -s). If it is 1, 2 or 3, output is in
        first, second or third canonical form. If it is i, output is a dump
        of the document's infoset. If it is d, output is in a form suitable
        for use with "diff"; in particular attributes are sorted into
        alphabetical order.
    -m  Merge PCData across entity references. This will only affect the
        output when -b is specified.
    -t  Read in the input as a tree, rather than bits. Should make no
        difference to the output.

   -u base_uri

   Use the specified base URI when resolving system identifiers.

    -U  This flag controls Unicode normalization checking and is only
        relevant when parsing XML 1.1 documents. If it is 0, no checking is
        done. If it is 1, rxp checks that the document is fully normalized as
        defined by the W3C character model. If it is 2, the document is
        checked and any unknown characters (which may be ones corresponding
        to a newer version of Unicode than rxp knows about) will also cause
        an error.
    -x  Strict XML mode. This suppresses some warnings (eg entity
        redefinitions) but treats all XML well-formedness errors as fatal.
        This flag implies the -a flag, and sets the output encoding to UTF-8
        unless the -c flag is given. It sets the output format to first
        canonical form unless the -o, -b or -s flag is given.

   -c encoding

   Produce output in the specified character encoding. Known encodings
   include ISO-8859-1, UTF-8, ISO-10646-UCS and UTF-16. 16-bit encoding names
   my be suffixed with -B or -L to specify big- or little-endian byte order
   (the default is the host byte order). If no -c or -x option is given,
   output is in the same encoding as the input document.

   -D name sysid

   Force use of the document type specified by sysid. The root element name
   for validation is name. Any DTD in the document is ignored. This flag does
   not imply validation; use -V if required.

    -i  Do xml:id processing. Attributes named xml:id are recognised as IDs
        even if not declared.
    -I  The same as -i, but in addition xml:id attributes are checked for
        uniqueness.
    -z  Use a shorter format for error messages. Particularly useful when
        using the parser in Emacs compilation mode, so that Emacs can find
        the error location.

EXIT STATUS

   If the -V flag is given, and the document is well-formed but not valid, 2
   is returned. If the document is not well-formed, or a system error occurs,
   1 is returned. Otherwise 0 is returned. Since the parser can expand
   external entities even when not validating, it treats certain errors which
   are technically validity errors as well-formedness errors. If -x is not
   specified, some well-formedness errors produce only warnings and do not
   affect the exit status.

ENVIRONMENT

   If the environment variable XML_CATALOG_FILES is set, XML catalog
   processing is enabled. The variable should be set to a space-separated
   list of catalog files. The variable XML_CATALOG_PREFER may be set to
   public or system to set the initial mode for catalog processing; the
   default is system.

   If the variable RXPURL is set, it is used as the URL of the document to
   parse. This may be useful in CGI scripts and the like to avoid shell
   parsing of a user-supplied argument.

   The variable http_proxy can be used to specify a proxy for HTTP
   connections. The syntax is hostname[:port].
