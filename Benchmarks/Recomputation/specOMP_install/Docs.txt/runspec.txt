   4 Quick reference

   Note: links to SPEC OMP2012 documents on this web page assume that you are
   reading the page from a directory that also contains the other SPEC
   OMP2012 documents. If by some chance you are reading this web page from a
   location where the links do not work, try accessing the referenced
   documents at one of the following locations:

     * www.spec.org/omp2012/Docs/
     * The $SPEC/Docs/ (Unix) or %SPEC%\Docs\ (Windows) directory on a system
       where SPEC OMP2012 has been installed.
     * The Docs/ directory on your SPEC OMP2012 distribution media.

1 Introduction

  1.1 Who Needs runspec?

   Everyone who uses SPEC OMP2012 needs runspec. It is the primary tool in
   the suite. It is used to build the benchmarks, run them, and report on
   their results. All users of OMP2012 should read this document.

   If you are a beginner, please start out by reading from the beginning
   through section 3.1 Simplest Usage. That will probably be enough to get
   you started.

  1.2 About Config Files

   In order to use runspec, you need a "config file", which contains detailed
   instructions about how to build and run the benchmarks. You may not have
   to learn much about config files in order to get started. Typically, you
   start off using a config file that someone else has previously written.

    1.2.1 Finding a config file

   Where can you find such a config file? There are various sources:

    1. Look in the directory $SPEC/config/ (Unix) or %SPEC%\config\
       (Windows). You may find that there is a already a config file there
       with a name that indicates that it is appropriate for your system. You
       may even find that default.cfg already contains settings that would be
       a good starting place for your system.

    2. Look at the SPEC web site (http://www.spec.org/omp2012/) for a OMP2012
       result submission that used your system, or a system similar to yours.
       You can download the config file from that submission.

    3. You can review the examples in
       $SPEC/config/Example*.cfg (Unix) or
       %SPEC%\config\Example*.cfg (Windows).
    4. Alternatively, you can write your own, using the instructions in
       config.html

    1.2.2 Naming your config file

   Once you have found a config file that you would like to use as a starting
   point, you will probably find it convenient to copy it and modify it
   according to your needs. There are various options:

     * You can copy the config file to default.cfg. Doing so means that you
       won't even need to mention --config on your runspec command line.

     * You might find it useful to name config files after the date and the
       test attempt: jan07a.cfg, jan07b.cfg, and so forth. This is alleged to
       make it easier to trace the history of an experiment set.

     * If you are sharing a testbed with other users, it is probably wise to
       name the config file after yourself. For example, if Yusuf is trying
       out the new Solaris Fortran95 compiler, he might say:

       cd $SPEC/config
       cp solaris-sparc-sunstudio.cfg yusuf-newF95.cfg
       vi yusuf-newF95.cfg

       and edit the new config file to add whatever options he wishes to try
       out in the new compiler.

    1.2.3 If you change only one thing...

   At first, you may hesitate to change settings in config files, until you
   have a chance to read config.html. But there is one thing that you might
   want to change right away. Look for a line that says:

   ext=

   That line determines what extension will be added to your binaries. If
   there are comments next to that line giving instructions ("# set ext to A
   for this, or to B for that"), then set it accordingly. But if there are no
   such instructions, then usually you are free to set the extension to
   whatever you like, which can be very useful to ensure that your binaries
   are not accidentally over-written. You might add your name in the
   extension, if you are sharing a testbed with others. Or, you may find it
   convenient to keep binaries for a series of experiments, to facilitate
   later analysis; if you're naming your config files with names such as
   jan07a.cfg, you might choose to use "ext=jan07a" in the config file.

  1.3 About Defaults

   The SPEC tools have followed two principles regarding defaults:

    1. There should always be a default for everything
    2. It should be easy to change the defaults

   This means (the good news) that something sensible will usually happen,
   even when you are not explicit about what you want. But it also means (the
   bad news) that if something unexpected happens, you may have to look in
   several places in order to figure out why it behaves differently than you
   expect.

   The order of precedence for settings is:

   Highest precedence: runspec command
   Middle:             config file
   Lowest:             the tools as shipped by SPEC

   Therefore, when this document tells you that something is the default,
   bear in mind that your config file may have changed that setting. With
   luck, the author of the config file will tell you so (perhaps in the
   comments to the config file).

  1.4 About Disk Usage

    1.4.1 Directory Tree

   The structure of the OMP2012 directory tree is:

 $SPEC or %SPEC% - the root directory
    Docs         - location for html documents concerning the benchmark suite
    Docs.txt     - location for text versions of the Docs tree
    benchspec    - some suite-wide files
       OMP2012   - the benchmarks
    bin          - tools to run and report on the suite
    config       - config files
    result       - log files and reports
    tools        - sources for the OMP2012 tools

   Within each of the individual benchmarks, the structure is:

 nnn.benchmark - root for this benchmark
    Docs       - Documentation about the benchmark
    Spec       - SPEC metadata about the benchmark
    data
       all     - data used by all runs (if needed by the benchmark)
       ref     - the real data set, required for all result reporting
       test    - data for a simple test that an executable is functional
       train   - data for feedback-directed optimization
    build      - all builds take place here
    exe        - compiled versions of the benchmark
    run        - all runs take place here
    src        - the sources for the benchmark

    1.4.2 Hey! Where did all my disk space go?

   When you find yourself wondering "Where did all my disk space go?", the
   answer is "The run directories." Most (*) activity takes place in
   automatically created subdirectories of $SPEC/benchspec/OMP2012/*/run/
   (Unix) or %SPEC%\benchspec\OMP2012\*\run\ (Windows).

   For example, suppose Bob has a config file that he is using to test some
   new memory optimizations, and has set

   ext=BobMemoryOpt

   in his config file. In that case, the tools would create directories such
   as these:

 $ pwd
 /Users/bob/omp2012/benchspec/OMP2012/350.md/run
 $ ls
 list
 run_base_test_BobMemoryOpt.0001
 run_base_train_BobMemoryOpt.0001
 run_base_ref_BobMemoryOpt.0001
 run_peak_test_BobMemoryOpt.0001
 run_peak_train_BobMemoryOpt.0001
 run_peak_ref_BobMemoryOpt.0001
 $

   To get your disk space back, see the documentation of the various cleaning
   options, below; or issue a command such as the following (on Unix systems;
   Windows users can select the files with Explorer):

   rm -Rf $SPEC/benchspec/OMP2012/*/run/run*BobMemory*

   The effect of the above command would be to delete all the run directories
   associated with the benchmarks which used extension *BobMemory*. Note that
   the command did not delete the directories where the benchmarks were built
   (...OMP2012/*/build/*); sometimes it can come in handy to keep the build
   directories, perhaps to assist with debugging.

   (*) Other space: In addition to the run directories, other consumers of
   disk space include: (1) temporary files; for a listing of these, see the
   documentation of keeptmp; and (2) the build directories. For the example
   above, underneath:

 /Users/bob/omp2012/benchspec/OMP2012/350.md/build/

   will be found:

 $ ls
 build_base_BobMemoryOpt.0001
 build_peak_BobMemoryOpt.0001

  1.5 Multi-user support

   (If you are not sharing a SPEC OMP2012 installation with other users, you
   can skip ahead to section 2.)

   The SPEC OMP2012 toolset provides support for multiple users of a single
   installation, but the tools also rely upon users to make appropriate
   choices regarding setup of operating-system file protections. This section
   describes the multi-user features and describes ways of organizing
   protections. First, to the features that are always enabled:

     * The SPEC-distributed source directories and data directories are not
       changed during testing. Instead, working directories are created as
       needed for builds and runs.

     * Each user's build and run directories are tagged with the name of the
       user that they belong to (in the file nnn.benchmark/run/list).
       Directories created for one user are not re-used for a different user.

     * Multiple users can run tests at the same time. (Of course, if the jobs
       compete with each other for resources, it is likely that they will run
       more slowly.)

     * Multiple users can even run the "same" test at the same time, and they
       will automatically be given separate run directories.

   If you have more than one user of SPEC OMP2012, you can use additional
   features and choose from several different ways to organize the on-disk
   layout to share usage of the product. The recommended way is described
   first.

  1.5.1 Recommended sharing method: output_root

   The recommended method for sharing a SPEC OMP2012 installation among
   multiple users has 4 steps:

   Step                            Example (Unix)
   Protect most of the SPEC tree   chmod -R ugo-w $SPEC
   read-only
   Allow shared access to the      chmod 1777 $SPEC/config
   config directory
   Keep your own config files      cp config/assignment1.cfg config/alan1.cfg
   Add an output_root to your      output_root=/home/${username}/spec
   config file

   More detail about the steps is below.

    1. Most of the OMP2012 tree is shared, and can be protected read-only.
       For example, on a Unix system, you might set protections with:

 chmod -R ugo-w $SPEC

    2. The one exception is the config directory, $SPEC/config/ (Unix) or
       %SPEC%\config\ (Windows), which needs to be a read/write directory
       shared by all the users. It is written to by users when they create
       config files, and by the tools themselves: config files are updated
       after successful builds to associate them with their binaries.

       On Unix, the above protection command needs to be supplemented with:

 chmod 1777 $SPEC/config

       which will have the effect (on most Unix systems) of allowing users to
       create config files which they can choose to protect to allow access
       only by themselves.

    3. Config files usually would not be shared between users. For example,
       students might create their own copies of a config file.

       Alan enters:

 cd /cs403
 . ./shrc
 cp config/assignment1.cfg config/alan1.cfg
 chmod u+w config/alan1.cfg
 runspec --config alan1 --action build 351.bwaves

       Wendy enters:

 cd /cs403
 . ./shrc
 cp config/assignment1.cfg config/wendy1.cfg
 chmod u+w config/wendy1.cfg
 runspec --config wendy1 --action build 351.bwaves

    4. Set output_root in the config files to change the destinations of the
       outputs.

       To see the effect of output_root, consider an example with and without
       the feature. If $SPEC is set to /cs403 and if ext=feb27a, then
       normally the build directory for 351.bwaves with base tuning would be:

       /cs403/benchspec/OMP2012/351.bwaves/run/build_base_feb27a.001

       But if the config files include (near the top, before any occurrence
       of a section marker):

 output_root=/home/${username}/spec
 ext=feb27a

       then Alan's build directory for 351.bwaves will be

       /home/alan/spec/benchspec/OMP2012/351.bwaves/run/build_base_feb27a.001

       and Wendy's will be

       /home/wendy/spec/benchspec/OMP2012/351.bwaves/run/build_base_feb27a.001

       With the above setting of output_root, log files and reports that
       would normally go to /cs403/result instead will go to
       /home/alan/spec/result and /home/wendy/spec/result. Alan will find
       hmmer executables underneath
       /home/alan/spec/benchspec/OMP2012/351.bwaves/exe. And so forth.

   Summary: output_root is the recommended way to separate users. Set the
   protection on the original tree to read-only, except for the config
   directory, which should be set to allow users to write, and protect, their
   own config files.

  1.5.2 Alternative sharing methods

   An alternative is to keep all the files in a single directory tree. In
   this case:

     * The directory tree must be writable by each of the users, which means
       that they have to trust each other not to modify or delete each
       others' files.

     * Directories such as result, nnn.benchmark/exe and nnn.benchmark/run
       are not segregated by user, so you can only have one version of (for
       example) benchspec/OMP2012/363.swim/exe/swim_base.jan07a

     * Note that user names do not appear in the directory names. For
       example, if Lizy, Aashish, and Ajay are sharing a directory tree on a
       Windows system, and each of them runs the ref workload for 350.md with
       base tuning and a config file that sets ext=wwc9, there will be three
       directories created:

       %SPEC%\benchspec\OMP2012\350.md\run\run_base_ref_wwc9.0001
       %SPEC%\benchspec\OMP2012\350.md\run\run_base_ref_wwc9.0002
       %SPEC%\benchspec\OMP2012\350.md\run\run_base_ref_wwc9.0003

       To discover which 350.md run directories belong to Lizy:

       F:\> cd %SPEC%\benchspec\OMP2012\350.md\run
       F:\omp2012\benchspec\OMP2012\350.md\run> findstr lizy list

       To discover which result files belong to Aashish:

       F:\omp2012> cd %SPEC%\result
       F:\omp2012\result> findstr aashish *log

       (Of course, on Unix, that would be grep instead of findstr).

   Name convention: Users sharing a tree can adopt conventions to make their
   files more readily identifiable. As mentioned above, you can set your
   config file name to match your own name, and do the same for the
   extension.

   Expid convention: Another alternative is to tag directories with labels
   that help to identify them based on an "experiment ID", with the config
   file feature expid, as described in config.html.

   Spend the disk space: A final alternative, of course, is to not share. You
   can simply give each user their own copy of the entire SPEC OMP2012
   directory tree. This may be the easiest way to ensure that there are no
   surprises (at the expense of extra disk space.)

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 Before Using runspec

   Before using runspec, you need to:

  2.1 Install OMP2012

   The runspec tool uses perl version 5.12.3, which is installed as specperl
   when you install OMP2012. If you haven't already installed the suite, then
   please see system-requirements.html followed by:

     * install-guide-unix.html or
     * install-guide-windows.html

  2.2 Find a config file

   You won't get far unless you have a config file, but fortunately you can
   get started by using a pre-existing config file. See About Config Files,
   above.

  2.3 Undefine SPEC

   If the environment variable SPEC is already defined (e.g. from a run of
   some other SPEC benchmark suite), it may be wise to undefine it first,
   e.g. by logging out and logging in, or by using whatever commands your
   system uses for removing definitions (such as unset).

   To check whether the variable is already defined, type

   echo $SPEC (Unix) or
   echo %SPEC% (Windows)

   On Unix systems, the desired output is nothing at all; on Windows systems,
   the desired output is %SPEC%.

   Similarly, if your PATH includes tools from some other SPEC suite, it may
   be wise to remove them from your path.

   Next, you need to set your path appropriately for your system type.
   See section 2.4 for Unix or section 2.5 for Windows.

  2.4 Setting the path: Unix (and Mac OSX)

   If you are using a Unix system, change your current directory to the
   top-level SPEC directory and source either shrc or cshrc:

     * For example, if you are using a Bourne-compatible shell (such as ash,
       bash, ksh, zsh), you could type:
       users$ cd /bigdisk/myke/omp2012
       omp2012$ . ./shrc     <-- that's dot-space-dot-slash-shrc
     * If you are using a csh-compatible shell, you could type:
       users% cd /bigdisk/bob/omp2012
       omp2012% source cshrc

   Note that it is, in general, a good idea to ensure that you understand
   what is in your path, and that you have only what you truly need. If you
   have non-standard versions of commonly used utilities in your path, you
   may avoid unpleasant surprises by taking them out.

   q. Do you have to be root? Occasionally, users of Unix systems have asked
   whether it is necessary to elevate privileges, or to become 'root', prior
   to entering the above command. SPEC recommends (*) that you do not become
   root, because: (1) To the best of SPEC's knowledge, no component of SPEC
   CPU needs to modify system directories, nor does any component need to
   call privileged system interfaces. (2) Therefore, if you find that it
   appears that there is some reason why you need to be root, the cause is
   likely to be outside the SPEC toolset - for example, disk protections, or
   quota limits. (3) For safe benchmarking, it is better to avoid being root,
   for the same reason that it is a good idea to wear seat belts in a car:
   accidents happen, humans make mistakes. For example, if you accidentally
   type:

   kill 1

   when you meant to say:

   kill %1

   then you will very grateful if you are not privileged at that moment.

   (*) This is only a recommendation, not a requirement nor a rule.

  2.5 Setting the path: Windows

   If you are using a Microsoft Windows system, start a Command Prompt Window
   (previously known as an "MSDOS window"). Change to the directory where you
   have installed OMP2012, then edit shrc.bat, following the instructions
   contained therein. For example:

   C:\> f:
   F:\> cd diego\omp2012
   F:\diego\omp2012\> copy shrc.bat shrc.bat.orig
   F:\diego\omp2012\> notepad shrc.bat

   and follow the instructions in shrc.bat to make the appropriate edits for
   your compiler paths.

   Caution: you may find that the lines are not correctly formatted (the text
   appears to be all run together) when you edit this file. If so, see the
   section "Using Text Files on Windows" in the Windows installation guide.

   You will have to uncomment one of two lines:

    rem set SHRC_COMPILER_PATH_SET=yes

   or

    rem set SHRC_PRECOMPILED=yes

   by removing "rem" from the beginning of the desired line.

   If you uncomment the first line, you will have to follow the instructions
   a few lines further on, to set up the environment for your compiler.

   If you uncomment the second line, you must have pre-compiled binaries for
   the benchmarks

   Note that it is, in general, a good idea to ensure that you understand
   what is in your path, and that you have only what you truly need. If you
   have non-standard versions of commonly used utilities in your path, you
   may avoid unpleasant surprises by taking them out. In order to help you
   understand your path, shrc.bat will print it after it is done.

   When you are done, set the path using your edited shrc.bat, for example:

   F:\diego\omp2012> shrc

  2.6 Make sure that you have enough disk space.

   Presumably, you checked to be sure you had enough space when you read
   system-requirements.html, but now might be a good time to double check
   that you still have enough. Typically, you will want to have at least 2 GB
   free disk space at the start of a run. Windows users can say "dir", and
   will find the free space at the bottom of the directory listing. Unix
   users can say "df -k ." to get a measure of freespace in KB.

   If you have done some runs, and you are wondering where your space has
   gone, see section 1.4.2.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

3 Using runspec

  3.1 Simplest usage

    3.1.1 Reportable run

   It is easiest to use runspec when:

     * Some kind person has already compiled the benchmarks.

     * That kind person provides both the compiled images and their
       corresponding config file (see About Config Files above).

     * The config file does not change the defaults in surprising or esoteric
       ways (see About Defaults above).

   In this lucky circumstance, all that needs to be done is to name the
   config file, select the benchmark suite name gross, decide how many
   threads you want to run, and say --reportable to attempt a full run.

   For example, suppose that Wilfried wants to give Ryan a config file and
   compiled binaries with some new optimizations for a Unix system. Wilfried
   might type something like this:

 [/usr/wilfried]$ cd $SPEC
 [/bigdisk/omp2012]$ spectar -cvf - be*/C*/*/exe/*newomp* config/newomp.cfg | specxz > newomp.tar.xz

   and then Ryan might type something like this:

 ryan% cd /usr/ryan/omp2012
 omp2012% bash
 bash-2.05$ . ./shrc
 bash-2.05$ specxz -dc newomp.tar.xz | spectar -xf -
 bash-2.05$ runspec --config newomp.cfg --nobuild --threads 32 --reportable gross

   In the example above, the --nobuild emphasizes that the tools should not
   attempt to build the binaries; instead, the prebuilt binaries should be
   used. If there is some reason why the tools don't like that idea (for
   example: the config file does not match the binaries), they will complain
   and refuse to run, but with --nobuild they won't go off and try to do a
   build.

   As a another example, suppose that Reinhold has given Kaivalya a Windows
   config file with changes from 12 August, and Kaivalya wants to run the
   suite. He might say something like this:

 F:\kaivalya\omp2012\> shrc
 F:\kaivalya\omp2012\> specxz -dc reinhold_aug12a.tar.xz | spectar -xf -
 F:\kaivalya\omp2012\> runspec --config reinhold_aug12a --threads 64 --reportable gross

    3.1.2 Running selected benchmarks

   If you want to run a subset of the benchmarks, rather than running the
   whole suite, you can name them. Since a reportable run uses an entire
   suite, you will need to turn off reportable:

 [/usr/mat/omp2012]$ runspec --config mat_dec25j.cfg --noreportable --threads 128 351.bwaves

    3.1.3 Output files

   Look for the output of your runspec command in the directory $SPEC/result
   (Unix) or %SPEC%\result (Windows). There, you will find log files and
   result files. More information about log files can be found in
   config.html.

   The format of the result files depends on what was selected in your config
   file, but will typically include at least .txt for ASCII text, and will
   always include .rsf, for raw (unformatted) run data. More information
   about result formats can be found below, under --output_format. Note that
   you can always re-generate the output, using the --rawformat option, also
   documented below.

   This concludes the section on simplest usage.
   If simple commands such as the above are not enough to meet your needs,
   you can find out about commonly used options by continuing to read the
   next 3 sections (3.2, 3.3, and 3.4).

  3.2 Syntax

   The syntax for the runspec command is:

 runspec [options] [list of benchmarks to run]

   Options are described in the following sections. There, you will notice
   that many options have both long and short names. The long names are
   invoked using two dashes, and the short names use only a single dash. For
   long names that take a parameter, you can optionally use an equals sign.
   Long names can also be abbreviated, provided that you still enter enough
   letters for uniqueness. For example, the following commands all do the
   same thing:

 runspec --config=dianne_july25a --debug=99 gross
 runspec --config dianne_july25a --debug 99 gross
 runspec --conf dianne_july25a   --deb 99   gross
 runspec -c dianne_july25a       -v 99      gross

   The list of benchmarks to run can be:

     * one or more individual benchmarks
     * an entire suite: gross for the suite
     * all to run the suite.

   For a reportable run, you must specify gross, or all.

    3.2.1 Benchmark names in run lists

   Individual benchmarks can be named, numbered, or both; and they can be
   abbreviated, as long as you enter enough characters for uniqueness. For
   example, each of the following commands does the same thing:

 runspec -c jason_july09d --noreportable 350.md 351.bwaves
 runspec -c jason_july09d --noreportable 350 351
 runspec -c jason_july09d --noreportable md bwaves
 runspec -c jason_july09d --noreportable md bw

   It is also possible to exclude a benchmark, using a hat (^, also known as
   carat, typically found as shift-6). For example, suppose your system lacks
   a C++ compiler, and you therefore cannot run the benchmark 376.kdtree. You
   could run all of the benchmarks except these by entering a command such as
   this one:

 runspec --noreportable -c kathy_sep14c gross ^kdtree

   Note that if hat has significance to your shell, you may need to protect
   it from interpretation by the shell, for example by putting it in single
   quotes. On Windows, you will need to use both a hat and double quotes for
   each benchmark you want to exclude, like this:

 E:\omp2012> runspec --noreportable -c cathy_apr21b gross  "^kdtree"

    3.2.2 Run order for reportable runs

   A reportable run runs all the benchmarks in a suite with the test and
   train data sets as an additional verification that the benchmark binaries
   get correct results. The test and train workloads are not timed. Then, the
   reference workloads are run three times, so that median run time can be
   determined for each benchmark. For example, here are the runs for a
   reportable run of OMP2012:

 $ grep runspec: *036.log
 runspec: runspec -c oss13 -T base --threads 12 --reportable gross
 $ grep Running *036.log

   The above order can be summarized as:

 test
 train
 ref1, ref2, ref3

   Sometimes, it can be useful to understand when directory setup occurs. So,
   let's expand the list to include setup:

 setup for test
 test
 setup for train
 train
 setup for ref
 ref1, ref2, ref3

    3.2.3 Run order when more than one tuning is present

   If you run both base and peak tuning, base is always run first. If you do
   a reportable run with both base and peak, the order is:

 setup for test
 base test, peak test
 setup for train
 base train, peak train
 setup for ref
 base ref1, base ref2, base ref3
 peak ref1, peak ref2, peak ref3

  3.3 Actions

   When runspec is used, it normally (*) takes some kind of action for the
   set of benchmarks specified at the end of the command line (or defaulted
   from the config file). The default action is validate, which means that
   the benchmarks will be built if necessary, the run directories will be set
   up, the benchmarks will be run, and reports will be generated.

   (*) Exception: if you use the --rawformat switch, then --action is
   ignored.

   If you want to cause a different action, then you can enter one of the
   following runspec options:

                       Compile the benchmarks. More information about
   --action build      compiling may be found in config.html, including
                       information about additional files that are output
                       during a build.
   --action buildsetup Set up build directories for the benchmarks, but do
                       not attempt to compile them.
   --action configpp   Preprocess the config file and dump it to stdout
                       Run the benchmarks but do not bother to verify that
                       they got the correct answers. Reports are always
                       marked "invalid", since the correctness checks are
   --action onlyrun    skipped. Therefore, this option is rarely useful, but
                       it can be selected if, for example, you are generating
                       a performance trace and wish to avoid tracing some of
                       the tools overhead.
   --action report     Synonym for --fakereport; see also --fakereportable.
   --action run        Synonym for --action validate.
   --action runsetup   Synonym for --action setup
   --action setup      Set up the run directories. Copy executables and data
                       to work directories.
   --action validate   Build (if needed), run, check for correct answers, and
                       generate reports.

   In addition, the following cleanup actions are available (in order by
   level of vigor):

                      Empty all run and build directories for the specified
                      benchmark set for the current user. For example, if the
                      current OS username is set to jeff and this command is
                      entered:
   --action clean     D:\omp2012\> runspec --action clean --config may12a
                      gross
                      then the tools will remove run directories with
                      username jeff for benchmarks generated by config file
                      may12a.cfg (in nnn.benchmark\run and
                      nnn.benchmark\build).
   --action clobber   Clean + remove all executables of the current type for
                      the specified benchmark set.
                      Same as clean, but do it for all users of this SPEC
   --action trash     directory tree, and all types, regardless of what's in
                      the config file.
   --action realclean A synonym for --action trash
   --action scrub     Remove everybody's run and build directories and all
                      executables for the specified benchmark set.

   Alternative cleaning method:

   If you prefer, you can clean disk space by entering commands such as the
   following (on Unix systems):

       rm -Rf $SPEC/benchspec/O*/*/build
       rm -Rf $SPEC/benchspec/O*/*/run
       rm -Rf $SPEC/benchspec/O*/*/exe

   Notes

    1. The above commands not only empty the contents of the run and exe
       directories; they also delete the directories themselves. That's fine;
       the tools will re-create the run and exe directories if they are
       needed again later on.

    2. The above commands do NOT clean the build directories (unless you've
       set build_in_build_dir=0). Often, it's useful to preserve the build
       directories for debugging purposes, but if you'd like to get rid of
       them too, just add $SPEC/benchspec/O*/*/build to your list of
       directories.

   Windows users:

   Windows users can achieve a similar effect using Windows Explorer.

   I have so much disk space, I'll never use all of it:

   Run directories are automatically re-used for subsequent runs. If you
   prefer, you can ask the tools to never touch a used run directory. Do this
   by setting the environment variable:

      SPEC_OMP2012_NO_RUNDIR_DEL

   In this case, you should be prepared to do frequent cleaning, perhaps
   after reviewing the results of each run.

  3.4 Commonly used options

   Most users of runspec will want to become familiar with the following
   options.

    --action action

     * Synonym: -a action
     * Default: validate
     * Meaning: One of the following actions that runspec can do for you:
       build, buildsetup, clean, clobber, configpp, onlyrun, realclean,
       report, run, runsetup, scrub, setup, trash, or validate. For more
       information, see Actions, above

    --check_version

     * Default: check only when doing reportable runs
     * Meaning: From time to time, SPEC may update the OMP2012 suite.
       Typically, SPEC will not publish results at www.spec.org/omp2012
       unless they have been run using the most recent update. Prior to
       investing substantial time running your tests, it is recommended that
       you check whether your version is up to date, either by saying runspec
       --check_version, or by adding the switch to whatever else you were
       doing on your runspec command. Note that if you are running within a
       firewall, you may need to add a proxy server to the command line. For
       example:

    runspec --check_version --http_proxy http://webcache.tom.spokewrenchdad.com:8080

       or, equivalently, for those who prefer to abbreviate to the shortest
       possible amount of typing:

    runspec --ch --http_p http://webcache.tom.spokewrenchdad.com:8080

       The command downloads a small file (~15 bytes) from www.spec.org which
       contains information about the most recent release, and compares that
       to your release. If your version is out of date, a warning will be
       printed.

    --config name

     * Synonym: -c name
     * Default: default.cfg
     * Meaning: Use config file $SPEC/config/name.cfg (Unix) or
       %SPEC%\config\name.cfg (Windows). If not specified, the tools will try
       default.cfg

    --flagsurl URL[,URL...]

     * Synonym: -F URL
     * Default: none
     * Meaning: A "flags file" provides information about how to interpret
       and report on the flags (e.g. -O5, -fast, etc.) that are used in a
       config file.

       The --flagsurl switch says that a flags file may be found at the
       specified URL (such as http://myflags.com/flags.xml). URL schemes
       supported are http, ftp, and file. A URL without a scheme is assumed
       to be a file or path name. If you need to specify an http proxy, you
       can do so in your config file, by using the --http_proxy command line
       switch, or via the environment variable http_proxy.

       This example formats a result with two flags files on Windows:

 rawformat --flagsurl %SPEC%\config\flags\tmp1.xml,%SPEC%\config\flags\tmp2.xml OMPG2012.059.ref.rsf

       The special value noflags may be used to cause rawformat to remove a
       stored flags file when re-formatting a previously run result.

       Flags files are required by run rule 4.2.5. If a run is marked
       "invalid" because some flags are "unknown", you may be able to resolve
       the invalid marking by finding, or creating, a flags file with proper
       descriptions and entering commands such as:

 cp OMPG2012.059.ref.rsf retry
 rawformat --flagsurl myfixedflags.xml --output_format pdf,raw retry

       The first command preserves the original raw file, which is always
       recommended before doing any operations that create a new raw file.
       The second command creates retry.rsf and retry.pdf, both of which will
       include descriptions of flags from myfixedflags.xml. If you are
       submitting a result to SPEC, the newly-generated rawfile is the one to
       submit.

       Note that saying rawformat is equivalent to saying runspec
       --rawformat, as described below.

       On Windows systems, the first command above would use copy instead of
       cp. Also, if Windows refuses to accept the syntax with a comma in it,
       you might have to generate just the rawfile as a first step, then
       generate other format(s).

       You can find out more about how to write flag description files in
       flag-description.html. You will find there a complete example of a
       flags file update using rawformat --flagsurl.

       You can format a single result using multiple flags files. This
       feature is intended to make it easier for multiple results to share
       what should be shared, while separating what should be separated.
       Common elements (such as a certain version of a compiler) can be
       placed into one flags file, while the elements that differ from one
       system to another (such as platform notes) can be maintained
       separately.

    --help

     * Synonyms: -h | -?
     * Default: Help text is not displayed.
     * Meaning: Print helpful text

    --ignore_errors

     * Synonyms: -I | --ignoreerror
     * Default: Stop on first error.
     * Meaning: Continue running even if errors occur.

    --iterations number

     * Synonym: -n number
     * Default: 3
     * Meaning: How many times to run each benchmark. For a reportable run,
       must be 3.

    --loose

     * Synonyms: -l | --nostrict | --noreportable
     * Default: loose
     * Meaning: Unset reportable. For example, suppose that you have a golden
       config file that is used for reportable runs, which sets the config
       file option reportable. However, you aren't ready to do a reportable
       run, because you first want to ensure that the system under test is
       adequately configured to run the benchmark 351.bwaves. Since the
       config file sets the option reportable, the following command will
       result in an error message:

 [/usr/mwong/omp2012]$ runspec --config golden --iterations 1 351.bwaves

       as the SPEC tools will inform you that you cannot change the number of
       iterations on a reportable run. But either of the following commands
       will override the config file and just run 351.bwaves once:

 [/usr/mwong/omp2012]$ runspec --config golden --iterations 1 --loose 351.bwaves
 [/usr/mwong/omp2012]$ runspec --config golden --iterations 1 --noreportable 351.bwaves

    --output_format format

     * Synonym: -o format
     * Default: HTML and text
     * Meaning: Desired report format, one or more of the following. If more
       than one option is used, separate them by commas. The values are not
       case-sensitive.

            all          implies all of the following except screen, check,
                         and mail
    cfg|config|conffile  config file used for this run (e.g.
    configfile|cfgfile   OMPG2012.030.ref.cfg)
                         Submission syntax check (automatically enabled for
                         reportable runs). Causes many fields to be checked
                         for acceptable formatting - e.g. hardware available
                         "Nov-2012", not "11/12"; memory size "4 GB", not
                         "4Gb"; and so forth. SPEC enforces consistent syntax
                         for results submitted to its website as an aid to
      check|chk|sub|     readers of results, and to increase the likelihood
   subcheck|subtest|test that queries find the intended results. If you
                         select --output_format subcheck on your local
                         system, you can find out about most formatting
                         problems before you submit your results to SPEC.
                         Even if you don't plan to submit your results to
                         SPEC, the Submission Check format can help you
                         create reports that are more complete and readable.
                         Comma-separated variable (e.g.
                         OMPG2012.030.ref.csv). If you populate spreadsheets
                         from your runs, you probably shouldn't be doing
                         cut/paste of text files; you'll get more accurate
      csv|spreadsheet    data by using --output_format csv.

                         CSV output includes much of the information in the
                         other reports. All runs times are included, and the
                         selected run times are listed separately. The flags
                         used are also included.
          default        implies HTML and text
                         Flag report (e.g. OMPG2012.030.flags.ref.html). Will
        flag|flags       also be produced when formats that use it are
                         requested (PDF, HTML).

                         This format is the design center for SPEC OMP2012
                         reporting. Other formats contain less information:
         pdf|adobe       text lacks graphs, postscript lacks hyperlinks, and
                         HTML is less structured. (It does not appear as part
                         of "default" only because some systems may lack the
                         ability to read PDF.)

          raw|rsf        will automatically get an rsf file for commands that
                         run a test or that update a result (such as
                         rawformat --flagsurl).
     screen|scr|disp|    ASCII text output to stdout.
   display|terminal|term
    text|txt|ASCII|asc   ASCII text, e.g. OMPG2012.030.ref.txt.

    --power --nopower

     * Synonym: none
     * Default: Do not change the use of power as selected elsewhere, default
       is no power measurement.
     * Meaning: Enable/disable the optional power measurement mode of the
       benchmark.

    --rawformat rawfiles

     * Synonym: -R rawfile
     * Default: Do not use rawformat mode.
     * Meaning: Do not attempt to do a run; instead, take an existing result
       file and just generate the reports. Using this option will cause any
       specified --actions to be ignored, and instead the result formatter
       will be invoked. This option is useful if (for example) you are just
       doing ASCII output during most of your runs, but now you would like to
       create additional reports for one or more especially interesting runs.
       To create the html and postscript files for experiment number 324, you
       could say:

 runspec --rawformat --output_format html,ps $SPEC/result/OMPG2012.324.ref.rsf

       You can achieve the same effect by invoking rawformat directly:

 rawformat --output_format html,ps $SPEC/result/OMPG2012.324.ref.rsf

       These two commands achieve the same effect because, in fact, saying
       runspec --rawformat just causes runspec to exit, invoking rawformat in
       its stead, and passing it whatever was on the command line - in this
       case, the --output_format html,ps string.

       Note that when runnng rawformat, you will always get format
       "Submission Check", which encourages consistent formatting for various
       result fields when preparing final (submittable) reports. In addition,
       you will get the formats that you mention on the command line, or, if
       none are mentioned there, then you will get the defaults documented
       under output_format.

       For more information about rawformat, please see utility.html.

    --rebuild

     * Synonym: -D
     * Default: Do not rebuild unless binary is missing or does not match the
       config file.
     * Meaning: Delete existing binaries and recompile. Use this if, for
       example, you have installed a new version of your compiler and want to
       force a rebuild of the benchmarks.

    --reportable

     * Synonyms: -s | --strict | --noloose
     * Default: loose
     * Meaning: Wherever it is practical to do so in an automated fashion,
       enforce the OMP2012 run rules, so as to produce a result which is
       suitable for public reporting and/or submission to SPEC. This option
       forces various other options, such as iterations =3. Note that when
       you do a reportable run, the list of benchmarks to run must be an
       entire suite.

    --threads number

     * Synonyms: none
     * Default: 1
     * Meaning: Use number to set the number of OMP_NUM_THREADS to use for
       the run. To use 32 threads for your run:

 omp2012% runspec --config tony_may12a --threads 32 gross

    --tune tuning

     * Synonyms: --tuning tuning | -T tuning
     * Default: base
     * Meaning: Selects tuning to use: base, peak, or all. For a reportable
       run, must be either base or all. Reportable runs do base first, then
       (optionally) peak.

  3.5 Less commonly used options

    --basepeak [bench,bench,...]

     * Synonym: None
     * Default: Do not do basepeak when reformatting results.
     * Meaning: This switch only has meaning in --rawformat mode, when
       reformatting previously-run results. When no arguments are specified,
       this switch will perform base to peak substitution for all benchmarks
       in the result file. If arguments are given, they must be the name of
       benchmarks or benchmark suites, and the base results for only those
       benchmarks will be copied over the peak results for only those
       benchmarks.
       Note: Use of this option will cause rawformat to output only a raw
       file. This is to help ensure that there is always a raw file present
       to match any generated results.

    --nobuild

     * Synonym: -N
     * Default: normally, the tools will make their own decision of whether
       to rebuild, based on whether the binaries exist, or whether they match
       the expected MD5 sums.
     * Meaning: Do not build binaries, even if they don't exist or MD5 sums
       don't match. This feature can be very handy if, for example, you have
       a long script with multiple invocations of runspec, and you would like
       to ensure that the build is only attempted once. (Perhaps your thought
       process might be, "If it fails the first time, fine, just forget about
       it until I come in Monday and look things over.") By adding --nobuild
       --ignore_errors to all runs after the first one, no attempt will be
       made to build the failed benchmarks after the first attempt.

       The --nobuild feature also comes in handy when testing whether
       proposed config file options would potentially force an automatic
       rebuild.

    --comment "comment text"

     * Synonym: None
     * Default: Add no comment.
     * Meaning: Adds a comment to the log file and the stored configuration
       file.

    --define SYMBOL[=VALUE]
    --define SYMBOL:VALUE

     * Synonym: -S SYMBOL[=VALUE]
       -S SYMBOL:VALUE
     * Default: Do not define config file preprocessor macros.
     * Meaning: Defines a preprocessor macro named SYMBOL (for use in your
       config file) and optionally gives it the value VALUE. If no value is
       specified, the macro is defined with no value. SYMBOL may not contain
       equals signs ("=") or colons (":"). This option may be used multiple
       times. For example if a config file says:

 %ifdef %{use_sparc_v9}
         ext            = darryl.native64
         mach           = native64
         ARCH_SELECT    = -xtarget=native64
 %else
         ext            = darryl.native32
         mach           = default
         ARCH_SELECT    = -xtarget=native
 %endif
 default=base:
 OPTIMIZE     = -O ${ARCH_SELECT}

       Then saying runspec --define use_sparc_v9=1 will cause base
       optimization to be -O -xtarget=native64

    --delay secs

     * Synonym: None
     * Default: Add no delay.
     * Meaning: Add a delay of the specified number of seconds before and
       after each benchmark (specinvoke) invocation. The delay is not counted
       toward the benchmark runtime. This option is silently ignored during
       reportable runs.

    --deletework

     * Synonym: -d
     * Default: Do not delete working directories.
     * Meaning: Delete run directories and re-populate. Use this if you
       suspect that the run directories may have been corrupted, for example
       due to a system crash during setup of an earlier run. You might also
       use this if you just wish to ensure clean run directories, but note
       that the tools will automatically provide what they deem to be a
       sufficient level of cleaning.

    --extension name[,name...]

     * Synonyms: --ext name[,name...] | -e name[,name...]
     * Default: none
     * Meaning: Extensions to build or run. Normally used only if the config
       file has been written to handle more than one extension. The config
       file author should tell you what extensions to enter under which
       circumstances. Note that if you specify multiple extensions, multiple
       separate builds and runs will be performed.
       Note: The extension used may only consist of alphanumeric characters,
       underscores, hyphens, and periods.
       Note to Windows users: Because of the command-line preprocessing
       performed by cmd.exe, this feature cannot be used on Windows.

    --fake

     * Synonyms: --dryrun | --dry-run
     * Default: Really do the actions requested.
     * Meaning: List, but do not execute, the commands needed to build or run
       the benchmarks.

          * Use --fake --action build to get a listing of the commands needed
            to build a benchmark.
          * Use --fake --action run to get a listing of the commands needed
            to run a benchmark. (If the benchmark executable does not exist,
            you will also get a listing of the needed build commands.)

       Runspec uses specmake -n and specinvoke -n to generate these listings.

    --fakereport

     * Synonyms: --action=report | --reportonly
     * Default: Not set
     * Meaning: Process the config file and generate output as if a run had
       been done. The results will all be zero, but otherwise the report will
       be correctly formatted, as if it had come from an actual run. Note
       that if your config file or command line includes options that would
       cause a real run to be marked invalid (for example, setting
       iterations=1 or --size=test), then the tools will also mark the fake
       report as invalid. If your goal is to get a preview of what the final,
       golden run will look like, you might prefer --fakereportable.

    --fakereportable

     * Synonyms: --mockup
     * Default: Not set
     * Meaning: Process the config file and generate output as if a
       "reportable" run had been done. The results will all be zero, but
       otherwise the report will be correctly formatted, as if it had come
       from a reportable run.

    --[no]feedback

     * Synonyms: none
     * Default: --feedback
     * Meaning: Normally, when any of the PASSn_xFLAGS are defined, the tools
       do multiple-pass compilation with training runs between each pass.
       Using --nofeedback will cause the PASSn flags to be ignored and a
       single-pass compilation will occur. Notice that explicitly specifying
       --feedback without having appropriate PASSn flags in the configuration
       file will have no effect. Specifying --feedback is therefore useful
       only as a means of overriding a previously specified --nofeedback, or
       as a means of overriding a config file setting of feedback=0. Be
       careful: the flag only overrides a global setting for feedback=0; it
       will not affect individual benchmarks that have this setting.

    --[no]graph_auto

     * Synonyms: --[no]graphauto
     * Default: --nograph_auto
     * Meaning: frees the tools to pick a value that they think appropriate
       for the top and bottom of the Y axis. The maximum and minimum chosen
       will attempt to let the viewer observe differences among the
       benchmarks. By default, the minimum will instead be anchored to zero.

    --graph_max N

     * Synonyms: --graphmax
     * Default: big enough (plus a little)
     * Meaning: Allows you to specify a new value for the maximum point on
       the graph scale.

    --graph_min N

     * Synonyms: --graphmin N
     * Default: 0
     * Meaning: Allows you to specify a new value for the minimum point on
       the graph scale.

    --http_proxy proxy[:port]

     * Synonyms: none
     * Default: none
     * Meaning: In some cases, such as when doing version checks and loading
       flag description files, runspec will attempt to fetch a file, using
       http. If your web browser needs a proxy server in order to access the
       outside world, then runspec will probably want to use the same proxy
       server. The proxy server can be set by:

          * The runspec --http_proxy switch, or
          * The environment variable http_proxy, or
          * Using the config file http_proxy option

       For example, a failure of this form:

 $ runspec --rawformat --output_format txt \
    --flagsurl http://portlandcyclers.net/evan.xml  OMPG2012.007.ref.rsf
 ...
 Retrieving flags file (http://portlandcyclers.net/evan.xml)...

 ERROR: Specified flags URL (http://portlandcyclers.net/evan.xml) could not be retrieved.
        The error returned was: 500 Can't connect to portlandcyclers.net:80
        (Bad hostname 'portlandcyclers.net')

       improves when a proxy is provided:

 $ runspec --rawformat --output_format txt \
    --flagsurl http://portlandcyclers.net/evan.xml  \
    --http_proxy=http://webcache.tom.spokewrenchdad.com:8080 OMPG2012.007.ref.rsf

       Note that this setting will override the value of the http_proxy
       environment variable, as well as any setting in the config file.

       By default, no proxy is used. The special value none may be used to
       unset any proxies set in the environment or via config file.

    --http_timeout N

     * Synonyms: none
     * Default: 30 seconds
     * Meaning: This is the amount of time (in seconds) to wait while
       attempting to fetch a file via HTTP. If the connection cannot be
       established in this amount of time, the attempt will be aborted.

    --info_wrap_columns N

     * Synonym: --infowrap N
     * Default: 50
     * Meaning: When set to a value greater than 0, attempts to split
       non-notes informational lines such that they are no longer than N
       columns wide. Lines are split on whitespace, and newly created lines
       are guaranteed to have at least the same indentation as the original
       line.
       If a line contains an item that is longer than N, a warning is logged
       and the original line is left unchanged.

    --[no]keeptmp

     * Synonym: None
     * Default: --nokeeptmp
     * Meaning: When set, temporary files such as compiler option output and
       temporary log files will not be removed. For a list of temporary file
       locations, see the discussion in config.html.

    --[no]log_timestamp

     * Synonym: --[no]log-timestamp
     * Default: --nolog_timestamp
     * Meaning: When set, lines output to the log file will have a time stamp
       prepended. The timestamp is always present in the debug log.

    --machine name[,name...]

     * Synonym: --mach name[,name...] | -m name[,name...]
     * Default: none
     * Meaning: The machines to build for or to run. Normally used only if
       the config file has been written to handle more than one machine type.
       The config file author should tell you what machines are supported by
       the config file.

       The machine name may only consist of alphanumerics, underscores,
       hyphens, and periods.

       If you specify multiple machine types, multiple runs will be
       performed, on most systems. On Microsoft Windows systems, because of
       the command-line preprocessing performed by cmd.exe, it is not
       possible to run more than one machine type.

       Warning: The "machine" feature is relatively rarely used, and is only
       lightly documented. The key limitation is that benchmark binary names
       contain only the extension. Therefore, it is quite possible, even
       easy, to cause binaries built in one run to be overwritten by
       subsequent runs. A workaround for this limitation is described in the
       description of "section specifiers", in config.html.

    --make_no_clobber

     * Synonym: -M
     * Default: clobber
     * Meaning: Do not delete existing object files before attempting to
       build. This option should only be used for troubleshooting a
       problematic compile. It is against the run rules to use it when
       building binaries for an actual submission.

       For a better way of troubleshooting a problematic compile, see the
       information about specmake in utility.html

    --make_bundle name

     * Synonym: --make-bundle name
     * Default: none
     * Meaning: Package up the currently selected set of binaries, config
       files and other support files into a bundle that can be used to
       re-create the current run on a different system or installation.

       When --make_bundle is present on the command line, most other switches
       have no immediate effect. The tools do not actually do the run at
       bundle creation time. Instead, a control file is written to the bundle
       to allow the run to occur on the destination system. The runspec
       command on the destination system will include all of your options
       other than those related to bundling.

       Optional: additional files or directories may be specified on the
       command line for inclusion in the bundle.

       Any such additional files must be underneath the $SPEC/ directory (or
       %SPEC%\ on Windows), but may not reside under any of the top-level
       subdirectories that ship with the suite (such as benchspec, bin,
       config, or result). Create a new subdirectory, such as %SPEC%\extras\
       (on Windows) or $SPEC/extras/ (Unix). If your compiler license allows
       redistribution of run time libraries, you could place copies of them
       in that subdirectory, and use preenv variables to point
       $LD_LIBRARY_PATH at them.

       In the following example, we begin by building a binary, check its
       runtime requirements, and populate a directory with the needed run
       time libraries:

 $ cat config/jul21a.cfg
 ext      = jul21a

 gross=default:
 CXX      = g++
 OPTIMIZE = -O

       Next, add the needed preENV line for the run time library to the
       config file. Then, bundle it all up:

 $ go config

 $ cat > tmp
 preENV_LD_LIBRARY_PATH = $[top]/extras/:\$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
 $ cat jul21a.cfg >> tmp

 Bundling finished.  The completed bundle is in
   /export/bmk/omp2012/mumble.omp2012bundle.xz
 ...

       The above command causes the entire contents of $SPEC/extras/ to be
       added to the bundle, along with the binary for 376.kdtree and the
       config file jul21a.cfg.

       Bundle verification: If you would like to verify the contents of a
       bundle, you can do so with "specxz -dc" and "spectar -tf -", like so:

       Don't worry about the odd looking extra files in the bundle; these are
       md5 checksums, which are used to help ensure bundle integrity.

       Using a bundle: See the descriptions of --use_bundle or
       --unpack_bundle for information on what to do with a bundle when
       you've got one.

       Note: --make_bundle can't bundle files up that aren't underneath the
       top-level $SPEC directory. If you use the output_root config file
       option with --make_bundle, please make sure that it points to
       somewhere under $SPEC.

       WARNING: Although the features to create and use bundles are intended
       to make it easier to run SPEC OMP2012, the tester remains responsible
       for compliance with the run rules. And, of course, both the creators
       and the users of bundles are responsible for compliance with any
       applicable software licenses.

    --notes_wrap_columns N

     * Synonym: --noteswrap
     * Default: 0 (disabled)
     * Meaning: When set to a value greater than 0, attempts to split notes
       lines such that they are no longer than N columns wide. Lines are
       split on whitespace, and newly created lines are guaranteed to have at
       least the same indentation as the original line.
       If a line contains an item that is longer than N, a warning is logged
       and the original line is left unchanged.

    --preenv, --nopreenv

     * Synonym: none
     * Default: True (preENV_ lines are used)
     * Meaning: When set, causes preENV_ lines in the config file to be used.
       Use of --nopreenv will disable this behavior.

    --review, --noreview

     * Synonym: none
     * Default: --noreview
     * Meaning: Format results for review, meaning that additional detail
       will be printed that normally would not be present. In lists of
       Portability Flags, benchmarks that do not use any flags are
       nevertheless listed, along with the notation "No flags used". Flags
       marked to be hidden (typically, splitters) will be displayed anyway,
       along with a notation that they are usually hidden.

    --setprocgroup, --nosetprocgroup

     * Synonyms: none
     * Default: --setprocgroup
     * Meaning: Attempt to create all processes in a single group. Improves
       the chances that ^C will get the whole run, not just one of the
       children.

    --size size[,size...]

     * Synonyms: -i size | --input size
     * Default: ref
     * Meaning: Selects size of input data to run: test, train, or ref. For
       example, you might choose to run test while debugging a new set of
       compilation options. Reportable runs ensure that your binaries can
       produce correct results with the test and train workloads and then run
       the ref workload 3 times for the actual measurements.

    --test

     * Synonyms: none
     * Default: do not run test
     * Meaning: Run various perl validation tests on specperl

    --table, --notable

     * Synonyms: none
     * Default: --table
     * Meaning: For ASCII reports, include a detailed table of all runs.

    --train_with WORKLOAD

     * Synonyms: none
     * Default: train
     * Meaning: Select the workload to use for training binaries built using
       feedback-directed optimization. Note that the training workload used
       is considered one of the build options, so this option (with identical
       argument) must be used each time the binaries themselves are used in
       order to prevent an automatic re-build. It's probably best to just set
       it in the config file instead. Note: it is unlikely that a OMP2012
       user would use this feature; see the additional detail on this topic
       in config.html.

    --undef SYMBOL

     * Synonym: None
     * Default:
     * Meaning: Removes the definition of any preprocessor macro named
       SYMBOL.
       This option may be used multiple times.

    --update

     * Synonym: --update_flags | --flagupdate | --flagsupdate | --newflags |
       --getflags
     * Default: do not check
     * Meaning: Checks www.spec.org for updates to the benchmark flag
       description files, config files, example flags files, and syntax files
       that ship with the OMP2012 distribution. Its usage requires a working
       internet connection. When this option is used, runspec will not
       perform any other actions. If you set your verbosity level to 7 or
       higher, you will get a list of files that are checked.

    --unpack_bundle name

     * Synonym: None
     * Default: none
     * Meaning: Unpack a previously-created bundle of binaries and config
       file, but do not attempt to start a run using the settings in the
       bundle. For your reference, the command that would have been used is
       printed out. See --make_bundle for more information about bundles.

    --use_bundle name

     * Synonym: None
     * Default: none
     * Meaning: Use a previously-created bundle of binaries and config file
       for the current run. Unless overridden, the run will use the set of
       extension, machine name, tuning levels, and benchmarks that were in
       effect when the bundle was created. If you specify a run that would
       use binaries that the current bundle doesn't contain, they will
       attempt to be built as usual before the run. See --make_bundle for
       more information about bundles.

       The following is an excerpt from the output that is printed when we

       Note in the example that runspec restarted itself twice. It unpacked
       the bundle, then restarted itself to run the command that had been
       entered at the time that the bundle was created. Upon doing so, it
       discovered the preENV line for $LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the config file. It
       applied the environment setting, then began all over again.

       applicable software licenses.

    --username name

     * Synonym: -U name
     * Default: same as current process
     * Meaning: Name of user. Useful if multiple users are sharing a SPEC
       tree. Please see About Disk Usage and Support for Multiple Users,
       above.

    --verbose n

     * Synonyms: --debug n | -v n
     * Default: 5
     * Meaning: Set verbosity level to a level between 1 and 99. For more
       information, see config.html

    --version

     * Synonym: -V
     * Default: Print short version information.
     * Meaning: Print detailed version information for the SPEC CPU tool
       suite.
