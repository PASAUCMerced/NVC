------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The redistributable_sources/licenses subdirectory on the SPEC OMP2012
distribution contains copies of the licenses that cover the freely-available 
and redistributable archives used for the OMP2012 suite.

The redistributable_sources/original subdirectory on the SPEC OMP2012
distribution contains archives of the original sources that were used 
for various OMP2012 tools and benchmarks.

The redistributable_sources/modified subdirectory on the SPEC OMP2012 
distribution contains archives of the sources, as modified by SPEC, for
various OMP2012 tools and benchmarks.

These archives are provided primarily for reference purposes, so that
interested parties can investigate the changes required to turn an
application into a benchmark.  Some of the archives must also be here
to satisfy requirements of their licenses.
