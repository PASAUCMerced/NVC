	cmacros - make certain macros more "C" like

This filepp module provides the module: cmacros

The cmacros module puts quotes around certain macros which would not
normally be quoted by filepp.  This makes filepp's output more like
the output of the C preprocessor which always puts quotes around these
macros.  The macros are:

__DATE__
__TIME__
__VERSION__
__BASE_FILE__
__FILE__

It is easy to modify the list of macros if required by editing the
module.

There is a simple test file included with this module.  To test the
for module use the following commands (the file "test.c" is in this
directory):

filepp -m cmacros.pm test.in

Also try:

filepp test.in

to see the effect of including the module.

For full documentation on how to use filepp and the comment module read
the filepp man page.
