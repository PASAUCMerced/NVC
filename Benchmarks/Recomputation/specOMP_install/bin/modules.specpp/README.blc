	blc - bracket line continuation

This is a filepp module which modifies line continuation so as well as
continuing lines which end in the line continuation character
(normally \), lines are also continued if they contain more open
brackets "(" than close brackets ")".  This makes it easier to call
macros with a long arguments.

There is a simple test file included with this module.  To test the
blc module use the following command (the file "test" is in this
directory):

filepp -m blc.pm test.in

For full documentation on how to use filepp and the blc module read
the filepp man page. 

Thanks to Zousar Shaker for writing the original version of this
function.
