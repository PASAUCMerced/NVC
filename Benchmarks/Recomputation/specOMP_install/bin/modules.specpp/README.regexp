	regexp - simple regular expression replacement module

This filepp module provides to module: regexp

This module allows Perl regular expression replacements to be done
with filepp.

Regular expressions are defined with the regexp keyword:

#regexp /regexp/replacement/

Each regular expression will be done on each line of the input files
using the Perl command:

	$line =~ s/regexp/replacement/g;

For those who don't understand Perl, this means replace all occurrences
of "regexp" in the current line with "replacement".

Regular expressions can be any Perl style regular expression, see the
Perl documentation for more information on this or the test file
included with this file for some examples.

Regular expressions are evaluated in the order they are defined.

A single regular expression can also be defined on the command line
using the REGEXP macro, for example:

filepp -DREGEXP=/regexp/replacement/ -m regexp.pm inputfile

Note: the REGEXP macro must be defined BEFORE the regexp module is
loaded, putting -DREGEXP... after -m regexp.pm will not work.  When
using the command line approach, if the REGEXP macro is sucessfully
parsed as a regular expression it will be undefined from the normal
filepp macro list before processing starts.
Care should obviously be taken when escaping special characters in the
shell with command line regexp's.

Regular expressions can be removed with the rmregexp keyword as
follows:

#rmregexp /regexp/replacement/

In debugging mode the current list of regular expressions can be
viewed using the pragma keyword:

#pragma filepp ShowRegexp

When not in debugging mode, this will produce no output.

Examplex of regular expressions can be found in the test file in this
directory.  Use the command:

filepp -m regexp.pm test.in

to see the results of parsing the file.

For full documentation on how to use filepp and the regexp module read
the filepp man page.
