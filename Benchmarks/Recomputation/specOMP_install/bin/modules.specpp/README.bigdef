	bigdef - Allow easy definition of multi-line macros

This is a filepp module which allows easy definition of multi-line
macros.  
It adds two keywords:
#bigdef MACRO DEFINITION
MORE DEFINITION
YET MORE DEFINITION
ETC.
#endbigdef

The syntax of #bigdef is the same as #define, only all lines following
the #bigdef up to the #endbigdef are included in the macro.

There is a simple test file included with this module.  To test the
bigdef module use the following command (the file "test" is in this
directory):

filepp -m bigdef.pm test.in

For full documentation on how to use filepp and the bigdef module read
the filepp man page.
