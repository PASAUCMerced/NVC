	cpp - a rudimentary C preprocessor

This filepp module provides the module: cpp

This module makes filepp behave in a similar manner to a C preprocessor.

DISCLAIMER: filepp is not meant to be a replacement for a C
preprocessor even with this module.  I would not recommend using
filepp as a C preprocessor unless you fully understand how it differs
from a real C preprocessor.  The output from filepp with the cpp
module is not guaranteed to be the same as a real C preprocessor.


For full documentation on how to use filepp and the comment module read
the filepp man page.
