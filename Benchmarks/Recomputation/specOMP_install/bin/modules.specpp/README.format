	format - Text formatting functions

This is a filepp module which allows formatting of text strings and
numbers using the Perl printf function.

The module provides a set of macros which will format their input
strings and return the formatted output.

There is a simple test file included with this module.  To test the
format module use the following command :

filepp -m format.pm test.in

For full documentation on how to use filepp and the format module read
the filepp man page.
