SITE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR SPEC BENCHMARK PRODUCTS

Read the terms and conditions of this Agreement carefully before
downloading or opening the package containing the benchmark program or any
accompanying documentation (collectively, the Materials").  This Agreement
represents the entire agreement between you and SPEC concerning the
Materials and supersedes any prior proposal, representation or
understanding between the parties. 

Use and Re-Export of SPEC's software is subject to the United States Export
Control Administration regulations. The software may not be used by
unlicensed persons or entities and may not be re-exported to another
country. See Export Assurance (Clause 10) of this license.

The restrictions and limitations of this Agreement do not apply to those
items contained in the Materials that have been modified under, or used
under, licenses that require free redistribution.  SPEC has collected
copies of all such items underneath the directory redistributable_sources,
along with the licenses applicable to each item in that directory.

By downloading or opening this package containing the benchmark program or
any accompanying documentation you are accepting and agreeing to the terms
of this Agreement. If you are not willing to be bound by these terms, you
should promptly cease downloading ?The Materials? or return the package to
receive a refund of your money.


        COMPANY/NAME:	
        MAIN SITE:		

1. Grant. SPEC agrees to grant and USER agrees to accept a nontransferable
   and nonexclusive license to use and modify the Materials, subject to the
   restrictions and conditions set forth below.

2. Copies and Location. USER may make only exact and complete copies of the
   original of the Materials. The original and copies thereof may be used
   only:
   * By the user, if purchased by a non-corporate entity. This user must
     also abide by the Export Assurance (Clause 10) of this license.
   * By anyone within the same corporate structure, if purchased by a
     corporation. Note that a "corporate user" must be identified and all
     technical support and contact with SPEC must be handled through that
     contact. This user and corporation must also abide by the Export
     Assurance (Clause 10) of this license.

   USER will not permit any third party to use or copy the original or any
   copy thereof.  In the event of unauthorized transfer or copying, USER
   will pay SPEC a penalty in the amount of one additional fee for each
   such transfer or copy.

3. Scope of Use. The Materials may be used only for the generation of data
   regarding measurement and analysis of computer system (hardware and
   software) performance on those Materials. Modification or merger with
   other software is allowed only as specified in the Run and Reporting
   Rules for the given SPEC benchmark product.

   USER may not distribute the Materials or any modification to the
   Materials with the following exceptions: 
   * USER may distribute those items specifically included in the directory
     of redistributable sources according to the terms of their open source
     licenses. 
   * USER may share only with other SPEC licensees of this benchmark
     modifications created by USER for purposes of performance analysis.
     Such modifications shall be limited to:
       1) modifying the code to instrument the benchmark; or
       2) modifying the workload to enable further performance analysis on
          systems under the USER's control; or
       3) a combination of 1) and 2). 

   For performance results obtained from such modified benchmark, USER may
   not 1) represent the results as being SPEC benchmark results or 2) use
   the official SPEC benchmark metric name(s) to identify the results.  The
   Materials may include executable code for the SPEC Power and Temperature
   Daemon (SPEC PTDaemon). The SPEC PTDaemon is licensed for use only with
   the Materials or modifications of the Materials as described herein. It
   is NOT licensed for use as a standalone tool or for integration into a
   tool that is unrelated to the Materials. 

4. Fee.  The fee paid by the USER to SPEC for the Materials is in
   consideration of SPEC's cost in connection with the distribution of the
   Materials and is not a royalty.

5. Reports. In order to preserve the integrity of SPEC's performance
   standards, USER agrees to run the Materials in accordance with the
   benchmark product rules published by SPEC for the Materials. If the USER
   chooses to publicly report measured results, the reporting must be
   strictly in accordance with both the benchmark product rules and the
   SPEC Fair Use Rule.

   The benchmark product rules are posted at www.spec.org, in the technical
   documentation pages for each benchmark product.  The SPEC Fair Use Rule
   is posted at www.spec.org/fairuse.html. Both the Fair Use Rule and the
   benchmark product rules may be updated from time to time. USERS are
   required to comply with the posted versions of the rules, including all
   updates. If substantive changes are made to the rules as solely
   determined by SPEC, a notice will be posted at SPEC's top-level page,
   www.spec.org, to define a transition period during which compliance
   shall be phased in.

6. Term.  This Agreement is effective upon USER downloading the Benchmark
   program or opening the package containing the Materials and shall
   continue until terminated.  USER may terminate the Agreement at any time
   by returning the Materials and all copies thereof to SPEC or destroying
   all physical and electronic copies of the Materials, but the provisions
   of Sections 5, 7 and 9 shall survive any termination.

   The license granted as to the current release of the Materials shall
   terminate when SPEC issues and makes available to the USER a subsequent
   release of such materials.  In the event of a breach by the USER of any
   provision hereof, SPEC may terminate this Agreement, and the licenses
   granted hereunder, in whole or as to any portion of the Materials upon
   30 days written notice unless the default is cured within such 30-day
   period.  Upon termination of the license, USER shall immediately return
   all copies of the Materials to SPEC or destroy all physical and
   electronic copies of the Materials.

7. Use of Name. It is acknowledged that all trademark and trade name rights
   in the names are owned exclusively by SPEC and such ownership shall be
   acknowledged in any use of the name by the USER (i.e. - noting that
   these are "trademarks of the Standard Performance Evaluation
   Corporation").

8. Indemnity.  USER agrees to indemnify and hold SPEC harmless from any
   claims, expenses, or liabilities caused by USER's use of the Materials
   or by USER's publication or use of data arising from its use of the
   Materials.

   Disclaimer of Warranties.  SPEC MAKES NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS
   OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SALE, USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE MATERIALS,
   INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE, AND ALL SUCH WARRANTIES ARE
   HEREBY DISCLAIMED AND EXCLUDED BY SPEC.

   USER RECOGNIZES THAT THE PRODUCTS ARE THE RESULT OF A COOPERATIVE, NON-
   PROFIT EFFORT AND THAT SPEC DOES NOT CONDUCT A TYPICAL BUSINESS.  USER
   ACCEPTS THE MATERIALS "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED.  HOWEVER, IF, UNDER NORMAL USE, ANY MEDIA DEFECT IS FOUND IN
   THE MATERIALS WITHIN NINETY (90) DAYS AFTER SHIPMENT TO THE USER, SPEC
   SHALL REPLACE THE MEDIA WITH A COPY WITHOUT MEDIA DEFECT, WHICH SHALL BE
   USER'S SOLE REMEDY.

9. Limitation of Liability.  SPEC assumes no liability with respect to the
   Materials, including liability for infringement of intellectual property
   rights, negligence, or any other liability.

   SPEC is not aware of any infringement of copyright or patent that may
   result from its transfer to USER of the Materials.  If USER receives any
   notice of infringement, such notice shall be immediately communicated to
   SPEC who will take immediate action to evaluate the claim and, if
   practicable, modify the Materials as necessary to avoid infringement.
   USER waives any claim against SPEC in the event of such infringement.

   SPEC's total liability for any reason shall not exceed the amount of the
   fee paid to SPEC.  In no event will SPEC be liable for any indirect,
   special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of or in
   connection with this Agreement, including the sale, use or performance
   of the Materials, even if SPEC shall have knowledge of the possibility
   of such damages.

10. Export Assurance.  Use and re-export of SPEC's software and related
    technical information is subject to the Export Administration
    Regulations (EAR) of the United States Department of Commerce.  USER
    hereby agrees that USER (a) assumes responsibility for compliance with
    the EAR in its use of the software and technical information, and (b)
    will not export, re-export, or otherwise disclose directly or
    indirectly, the software, technical data, or any direct product of the
    software or technical data in violation of the EAR.

11. Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be construed and governed in
    accordance with the laws of the State of California.  If any term of
    this Agreement is declared void or not enforceable by any competent
    court of jurisdiction, all other terms shall remain in effect.

12. No Waiver.  The failure of either party to enforce any term herein or
    to take action in the event of any violation of these terms shall not
    be deemed a waiver by that party as to the subsequent enforcement of
    any rights.
