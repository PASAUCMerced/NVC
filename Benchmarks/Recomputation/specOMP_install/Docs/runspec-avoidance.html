<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>This document is for those who prefer to avoid using some of the SPEC-supplied tools, typically because of a need for more
direct access to the benchmarks.  For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Some users want to work directly with benchmark source code and compile by hand, rather than through the SPEC supplied tools.
  Perhaps an experimental compiler is under development, and it is more convenient to just issue "<tt>cc</tt>" commands in a sandbox.
  Perhaps a custom build process is needed in order to add instrumentation.</p></li>

  <li><p>Some users want to run the benchmarks directly from the command line, rather than via the SPEC supplied tools.  Perhaps this is
  part of a debugging effort, or is needed in order to collect a performance "trace".</p></li>

</ul>

<p>If the above describes you, here is a suggested path which should lead quickly to your desired state.  This document 
shows you how to use SPEC's tools for the minimal purpose of just generating work directories, for use as a private
sandbox.  <b>Note, </b> however, that you cannot do formal, "reportable" runs without using SPEC's toolset.</p>


<h2 id="env">Environments</h2>

<p>Three different environments are referenced in this document, using these labels:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>"<i>Unified</i>": The SPEC toolset, the compilers, and the run environment are all on the same system.</p></li>
<li><p>"<i>Cross compile</i>": The SPEC toolset and the compilers are on one system; the run time environment is a different
system.</p> </li>
<li><p>"<i>Triple</i>": The SPEC toolset is on one system, the compiler is on a second, and the run time environment is a
third.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li id="rules"> 

    <p><b>Review two rules:</b> Please read just one page from <a class="external" href="runrules.html#section4.5">runrules.html</a>, namely "<cite>4.5
    Research and Academic usage of OMP2012</cite>" and "<cite>4.4 Required Disclosures</cite>"</p>

    <p>These run rules sections acknowledge that the suite may be used in ways other than the formal environment that the
    tools help to enforce; but they warn that if you plan to publish your results, you should be able to state HOW your usage
    of the suite differs from the standard usage.</p>  

    <p>So even if you skip over the tools and the run rules today, you should plan a time to come back and learn them
    later.</p></li>


<li id="install"> 
   <p><b>Install:</b> Get through a successful installation, even if it is on a different system than the one that you care
   about.  Yes, we are about to teach you how to mostly bypass the tools, but there will still be some minimal use.  So you
   need a working toolset and a valid installation.  If you have troubles with the install procedures described in <a
   class="external" href="install-guide-unix.html">install-guide-unix.html</a> or <a
   class="external" href="install-guide-windows.html">install-guide-windows.html</a>, please see <a
   class="external" href="techsupport.html">techsupport.html</a> and we'll try to help you.</p></li>


<li id="pickone">
   <p><b>Pick a benchmark:</b> Pick a benchmark that will be your starting point.</p>

    <p>Choose one benchmark from the OMP2012 suite that you'd like to start with.  For example, you might start with
    363.swim (Fortran) or 359.botsspar (C).  These are two of the shortest benchmarks for lines of code, and therefore
    relatively easy to understand.</p></li>

<li id="getconfig">
    <p><b>Pick a config file:</b> Pick a config file for an environment that resembles your environment.  You'll find a
    variety of config files in the directory <span class="ttnobr">$SPEC/config/</span> on Unix systems, or <span
    class="ttnobr">%SPEC%\config\</span> on Windows, or at <a class="external" href="http://www.spec.org/omp2012">www.spec.org/omp2012</a>
    with the submitted OMP2012 results.  Don't worry if the config file you pick doesn't exactly match your environment;
    you're just looking for a somewhat reasonable starting point.</p></li>

<li id="makedirs"> 
    <p><b>Fake it:</b> Execute a "fake" run to set up run directories, including a build directory for source code, for the
    benchmark.</p>

    <p>For example, let's suppose that you want to work with 363.swim and your environment is at least partially similar to
    the environment described in the comments for <span class="ttnobr">$SPEC/config/example-sgi-linux-x86_64-intel.cfg</span>   </p>

    <p>[Other Unix-like systems should behave similarly to the example in this section.]</p>

    <p>For example, you could enter the following commands:
<!-- better now? --></p>

<pre>
  % <b>sh</b>      
      ... if you're not already in a Bourne-compatible shell
  $ <b>cd  /myspecdisk/tools/omp2012/</b>
      ... or wherever you installed the SPEC OMP2012 tree
  $ <b>. ./shrc</b>      (that's dot-space-dot-slash-shrc)*
  $ <b>cd config</b>
  $ <b>cp example-sgi-linux-x86_64-intel.cfg my_test.cfg</b>
  $ <b>go</b>          (to the $SPEC directory)

  $ <b>runspec --fake --loose --size test --threads 16 --tune base --config my_test swim </b>
</pre>

    <p>This command should report a success for the build, run and validation phases of the test case, but the actual
    commands have not been run.  It is only a report of what would be run according to the config file that you have
    supplied.  </p> </li>

<li id="findlog">
    <p><b>Find the log:</b> Near the bottom of the output from the previous step, notice the location of the log file for
    this run.  The log file contains a record of the commands as reported by the "fake" run.  You can find the commands by
    searching for "<tt>%%</tt>".</p></li>

<li id="findbuild">
    <p><b>Find the build dir:</b> To find the build directory that was set up in the fake run go to the <tt>build</tt>
    directory for that benchmark.  For example:,</p>
<pre>
  $ <b>cd $SPEC/benchspec/OMP2012/363.swim/build</b>  ( or 'go 363 build' )
  $ <b>ls -ltd *build*</b>
</pre>
    <p>The above command prints the names of each build subdirectory, with the most recent first.  (On Windows, the analogous
    comamnd would use reversed slashes, and "<tt>$SPEC</tt>" is spelt "<tt>%SPEC%</tt>".  Instead of "<tt>ls -ltd</tt>", you
    would say something like "<span class="ttnobr">dir build*/o:d</span>".)  If this is your first time here, there will be
    only one directory listed, e.g. <span class="ttnobr">build_base_sgi-x86_64.0000</span></p>

    <p>You can work in this build directory, make source code changes, and try other build commands without affecting the
    original sources.  </p>  </li>

<li id="copy">
   <p><b>Copy the build dir (triple only):</b> If you are using a unified or cross-compile <a href="#env">environment</a>,
   you can skip to the next step.  But if you are using a triple environment, then you will want to package up the build
   directory with a program such as <tt>tar</tt> --  a handy copy is in the <tt>bin</tt> directory of your SPEC installation,
   as <tt>spectar</tt>.  Then, you will move the package off to whatever system has compilers.</p>
   
   <p>For example, you might say something like this:</p>
<pre>
  $ <b>spectar -cvf  -  build_base_sgi-x86_64.0000 | specxz > mybuild.tar.xz</b>
  $ <b>ftp</b>
  ftp&gt; <b>op buildsys</b>
  Connected to buildsys
  Name: <b>whoever</b>
  Password:
  ftp&gt; <b>bin</b>
  ftp&gt; <b>put mybuild.tar.xz</b>
</pre>
   <p>Note that the above example assumes that you have versions of <tt>xz</tt> and <tt>tar</tt> available on the system that has
   compilers, which you will use to unpack the compressed tarfile, typically with something like this:</p>
   <p class="l1ex"><b>xz -dc mybuild.tar.xz | tar -xvf  -</b></p></li>

<li id="buildit"> 
    <p><b>Build it:</b> Generate an executable using the build directory.  If you are using a unified or cross-compile <a
    href="#env">environment</a>, then you can say commands such as these:</p>
<pre>
  $ <b>cd build_base_sgi-x86_64.0000</b>
        ...assuming only one such build directory
  $ <b>specmake clean</b>
        ...only if there is a previous build 
  $ <b>specmake</b>
  ifort -c -o swim.o -O3 -xSSE4.2 -openmp -mcmodel=medium -shared-intel swim.f
  ... 
</pre> 

   <p class="snugtop">You can also carry out a dry run of the build, which will display the build commands without attempting
   to run them, by adding <tt>-n</tt> to the <tt>specmake</tt> command line.  You might find it useful to capture the output of
   <span class="ttnobr">specmake -n</span> to a file, so it can easily be edited, and used as a script.</p>

   <p><b>Re-build with (for example) different optimization flags:</b>
<pre>
  $ <b>vi Makefile.spec</b>
        ...edit the values of the FOPTIMIZE and perhaps EXTRA_LDFLAGS variables
  $ <b>specmake clean</b>
  $ <b>specmake</b>
  ifort -c -o swim.o -O3 -xSSE4.2 -ipo1 -openmp -mcmodel=medium -shared-intel swim.f

  ... 
</pre></p> 


   <p>If you are trying to debug a new system, you can prototype changes to <span class="ttnobr">Makefile.spec</span> or even 
   to the benchmark sources.</p>  
   
   <p>If you are using a triple <a href="#env">environment</a>, then presumably it's because you don't have <tt>specmake</tt>
   working on the system where the compiler resides.  But fear not: <tt>specmake</tt> is just GNU make under another name, so
   whatever <tt>make</tt> you have handy on the target system might work fine with the above commands.  If not, then you'll
   need to extract the build commands from the <a href="#findlog">log</a> and try them on the system that has the
   compilers.</p>

   </li>

<li id="rename"> 
   <p><b>Figure out the correct name for the binary:</b>  Once you have built an executable image, figure out its new name.
   You can either rename it now, in the build directory; or you can do so when you copy it to the run directory (next step).
   The new name will need to be of the form:</p>
   <p class="l1ex">&lt;exename&gt;_&lt;tuning&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;</p>
   <p> where:</p>

   <ul>
   <li><tt>exename</tt> is typically the same as the name of the benchmark, but not always.  The precise string can be
   found by saying 
   <br /><span class="ttnobr">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grep exename $SPEC/benchspec/OMP2012/<i>nnn.benchmark</i>/Spec/object.pm</span>
   <br />(On Windows, of course, you would spell "<tt>$SPEC</tt>" as "<tt>%SPEC%</tt>", turn the slashes around, and use 
   <tt>findstr</tt>)</li>
   <li><tt>tuning</tt> is either <tt>base</tt> or <tt>peak</tt></li>
   <li><tt>extension</tt> is the extension specified in your config file.  </li>
   </ul>

   <p class="snugbot">For example, if you are working with 363.swim and your config file has the line</p> 
   <p class="l1ex">ext=sgi-x86_64</p>
   <p class="snugtop">you would rename your executable to <span class="ttnobr">swim_base.sgi-x86_64</span></p> </li>

<li id="findrun"> 
    <p><b>Place the binary in the run dir:</b> Using techniques similar to those used to find the build directory, find the
    run directory established <a href="#makedirs">above</a>, and place the binary into it.  If you are using a unified or
    cross-compile <a href="#env">environment</a>, you can copy the binary directly into the run directory; if you are using a
    triple environment, then you'll have to retrieve the binary from the compilation system using whatever program (such as
    <tt>ftp</tt>) you use to communicate between systems.</p>
    
    <p>In a unified environment, the commands might look something like this:</p>

<pre>
  $ <b>go swim run</b>
  $ <b>ls -td run* </b>
  run_base_test_sgi-x86_64.0000
  $ <b>cd run_base_test_sgi-x86_64.0000</b>
  $ <b>cp ../build_base_sgi-x86_64.0000/swim_base.sgi-x86_64  . </b>
</pre></li>

<li id="copyrun">
   <p><b>Copy the run dir:</b> If you are using a unified <a href="#env">environment</a>, you can skip this step.  Otherwise,
   you'll need to package up the run directory and transport it to the system where you want to run the benchmark.  For
   example:</p>

<pre>
  $ <b>cd $SPEC/benchspec/OMP2012/363.swim/run</b>
  $ <b>spectar cvf  -  run_base_test_sgi-x86_64.0000 | specxz > myrun.tar.xz</b>
  $ <b>ftp</b>
  ftp&gt; <b>op runsys</b>
  Connected to runsys
  Name: <b>whoever</b>
  Password:
  ftp&gt; <b>bin</b>
  ftp&gt; <b>put myrun.tar.xz</b>
</pre>
   <p>Note that the above example assumes that you have versions of <tt>bzip2</tt> and <tt>tar</tt> available on the run time
   system, which you will use to unpack the compressed tarfile, typically with something like this:</p>
   <p class="l1ex"><b>xz -dc myrun.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf  -</b></p></li>

<li id="runit">
    <p><b>Run it:</b> If you are using a unified <a href="#env">environment</a>, you are now ready to try
    "<tt>specinvoke</tt>":</p>
<pre>
  $ <b>specinvoke -n</b>
        ... shows the command line that executes the benchmark, in this example 

# specinvoke r6392
#  Invoked as: specinvoke -n
# timer ticks over every 1000 ns
# Use another -n on the command line to see chdir commands and env dump
# Starting run for copy #0
dplace -x2 ../run_base_test_sgi_x86.0000/swim_base.sgi-x86_64 < swim.in > swim.out 2>> swim.err

  $ <b>specinvoke -h</b>
        ... explains other options to specinvoke, including '-i #' 
            for running multiple iterations
  $ <b>specinvoke</b>
        ... executes that command line
</pre>

  <p>If you are using a cross-compile or triple environment, then you won't be able to use <tt>specinvoke</tt>.  Instead,
  you'll need to extract the run commands from the <a href="#log">log</a> and enter them by hand.</p>
     </li>

<li id="savework"> 
   <p><b>Save your work:</b> Important: if you are at all interested in saving your work, move the <span
   class="ttnobr">run/build*</span> and <span class="ttnobr">run/run*</span> directories to some safer location.  That way,
   your work areas will not be accidentally deleted the next time someone comes along and uses one of <tt>runspec</tt> 
   <a class="external" href="runspec.html#cleaning">cleanup actions.</a>.</p></li>

<li id="moredirs"> 
   <p><b>Repeat:</b> Admittedly, the large number of steps that it took to get here may seem like a lot of trouble.  But
   that's why you <a href="#pickone">started</a> with a simple benchmark and the simplest workload (<span
   class="ttnobr">--size test</span> in the <a href="#makedirs">fake step</a>).  Now that you've got the pattern down, it is
   hoped that it will be straightforward to repeat the process for the other available workloads: <span
   class="ttnobr">--size=train</span> and <span class="ttnobr">--size=ref</span>, and then for additional
   benchmarks.</p>
    
    <p>But if you're finding it tedious... then maybe this is an opportunity to sell you on the notion of using <a
    class="external" href="runspec.html">runspec</a> after all, which automates all this tedium.  If the reason you came here was because
    <tt>runspec</tt> doesn't work on your brand-new environment, then perhaps you'll want to try to get it built, using the
    hints in <a class="external" href="tools-build.html">tools-build.html</a>.</p></li>

</ol>

<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>

<p>Note that this document has only discussed getting the benchmarks built and running.  Presumably at some point you'd like
to know whether your system got the correct answer.  At that point, you can use <tt>specdiff</tt>, which is explained in <a
class="external" href="utility.html#specdiff">utility.html</a>.  </p>

<hr />
<p>*  dot-space-dot-slash-shrc is the safe way to type it.  If you use Linux/bash, or if you 
have the current directory in your path, you can probably type ". shrc" (dot-space-shrc) with no problems.
