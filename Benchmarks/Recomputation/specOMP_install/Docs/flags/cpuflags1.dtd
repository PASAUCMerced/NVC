   benchmark suites using the SPEC CPU benchmark harness.

   ...is what I'd like to say, but we don't have a SPEC entry in any of
   the catalogs, so we'll just have to make do with SYSTEM for now.

<!-- The filename element allows the flag description writer to SUGGEST
     a filename to use when storing a flag description that has been
     transmitted via a non-name-preserving channel (encoded into a raw file,
     flags file upload to SPEC, etc).
-->
<!ELEMENT filename (#PCDATA)>

<!-- The title element contains the text that will be used in the
     <title>...</title> section of the HTML flag dump.
-->
<!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>

<!-- style is an optional element which may contain CSS code to be
     inserted at the bottom of the local <style>..</style> section.
     This can be used to define new classes (which you can use in your
     header section and flag descriptions), or to override the supplied
     default styles.  For ease of use, the CSS code should probably be
     contained within a CDATA section:
     !<[CDATA[
     ...CSS goes here...
     ]]>
-->
<!ELEMENT style (#PCDATA)>

<!-- header is an optional element which may contain HTML code to be
     inserted at the top of the HTML flag dump and (default class only)
     at the top of the per-result flag report.  For ease of use, the HTML
     markup should be contained within a CDATA section:
     !<[CDATA[
     ...HTML goes here...
     ]]>
-->
<!ELEMENT header (#PCDATA)>

      class (%Classes;) #IMPLIED

<!-- platform_settings is an optional element which may contain HTML code to
     be inserted at the bottom of the HTML flags dump and the per-result flags
     report.
     For ease of use, the HTML markup should be contained within a CDATA
     section:
     !<[CDATA[
     ...HTML goes here...
     ]]>
-->
<!ELEMENT platform_settings (#PCDATA)>

     attributes and their values is long and has already been written.  See
     the reference at the top of the page.

     appropriate for display.

<!ELEMENT example (#PCDATA)>

<!-- ex_replacement is used to specify one or more values for replacing
     $1, $2, etc in description text when that text is to be output and
     no replacement text from a match is available (as when formatting the
     whole list of flags as HTML).
-->
<!ELEMENT ex_replacement (#PCDATA)>

<!-- The include element is used to note that a flag either implies the
     presence of another flag (the 'flag' attribute) or should insert
     some text back into the variable in which it matched (the 'text'
     attribute.  The 'flagtext' attribute is used ONLY in conjunction with
     the 'flag' attribute to specify the text of a flag that should be used
     for display.

<!-- The display element is used to specify whether or not a particular
     flag description should be displayed.  A flag must be marked for
     display (the default) unless it contains ONLY text includes.  The
     DTD does not enforce this, but runspec and friends will.
