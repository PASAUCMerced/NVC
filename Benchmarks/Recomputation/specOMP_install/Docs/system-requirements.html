<h2 id="requirements">I. Hardware and Software Requirements</h2>

<p>To run and install SPEC OMP2012, the following are required.</p>


<h3 id="sysarch">A. System/OS:</h3> 
   
   <p>You will need a computer system running UNIX, Microsoft Windows, or Mac OS X.  
The benchmark suite includes a toolset. 
   Pre-compiled versions of the toolset are provided that are expected to work with:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>AIX: PowerPC systems running AIX 5L V5.3 or later</li>
      <li>Linux: The SPEC tools are compatible with many contemporary (year 2011) Linux distributions for Itanium, PowerPC,
      and x86, and with many older versions.   For an exact list of the Linux tool sets, where they were built, and their
      expected compatibility, please see the <a href="#linux">table below</a>.  </li>
      <li>MacOS X 10.4 or later on Intel systems.</li>
      <li>Solaris: SPARC systems running Solaris 8 or later</li>
      <li>Solaris: x86 systems running Solaris 9 9/05  or later</li>
      <li>Windows: Microsoft Windows XP or later on x86 or x86_64 systems </li>
      </ul>

     <p>Please ensure that you meet the minimum required version prior to installing SPEC OMP2012 V1.2.</p>

     <p>For systems not listed in above, such as earlier or later versions of the above systems, you may find that the tools
     also work, but SPEC has not tested them.  Windows systems that are not based on NT, such as Windows 95, Windows 98, and
     Windows ME, will definitely NOT work.  Please see the <a href="#port">Portability Notes</a> below.</p>

     <p>Even though tools are provided for
Windows and MacOS, the benchmark is <span class="u">unsupported</span> 
for these systems because there has been no testing done with them.
The toolsets are provided as a courtesy in case you want to see if
the benchmark does work on these OS. </p> 


<p class="snugbot"><b>Caution:</b></p>
<ul class="snugtop">
   <li class="tight">Unsupported toolsets are provided as a courtesy, as a service to users who may have the listed
   platform(s).</li>
   <li class="tight">Unsupported toolsets have been tested much less extensively than other tool sets and might or might not
   work.</li>
   <li class="tight"><p class="snug">More importantly, some of the benchmarks themselves have not been ported for the environments
   represented by the unsupported toolsets:</p>
   <ul>
      <li class="tight">Therefore, if you use an unsupported toolset, you will need to dedicate time to a porting effort. </li>
      <li class="tight"><span class="u">Please especially notice</span> that it is impossible to do a <a
      class="external" href="runspec.html#reportable">reportable</a> run on an unsupported system until such time as SPEC
      approves any source changes and/or portability flags needed for such system.</li>
      <li class="tight">For more information about obtaining SPEC approval for source changes, see <a
      class="external" href="techsupport.html#source">techsupport.html</a>.</li>
   </ul></li>
</ul>


<h4 id="linux">I.A.1. About Linux distributions</h4> 

   <p class="l1">Over time, various mechanisms have evolved on Linux, including libraries, 32-bit/64-bit support, executable format,
   linking, and run-time loading.  These mechanisms have sometimes forked with Linux distributions and then occasionally
   rejoined later.  SPEC OMP2012 has been tested with a variety of Linux distributions, but the possibility remains that you
   may encounter incompatibilities if you are not using *exactly* the same version as was used when the tools were built.
   Therefore, the table that follows tells you exactly what was used.</p>

   <p class="l1">If you find that you are unable to install the pre-compiled SPEC OMP2012 on Linux, and you would like to build
   the tools yourself, please see the notes in <a class="external" href="tools-build.html">tools-build.html</a>.  SPEC may be able
   to provide advice for your build, but SPEC does not promise that you will succeed.  Please see the limitations described in <a
   class="external" href="techsupport.html#limits">techsuport.html</a>.</p> 

      <table style="margin:1em 4em;">
      <tr>
          <th>Toolset name</th>
          <th>Expected compatibility</th>

         <td>Built on SuSE Linux 10 with GCC v4.1.0 (SUSE Linux)</td>
      </tr>
      </table>

<h4 id="winunix">I.A.2. SPEC does not recommend use of Windows/Unix compatibility products with OMP2012</h4>

<p>SPEC does not recommend installation of OMP2012 on Microsoft Windows under Windows/Unix compatibility environments (such as
Cygwin, MinGW, MKS, SFU, and so forth).  The tools and benchmarks have not been ported to such environments.  Please install
from an ordinary command window (formerly known as an MS-DOS window).  </p>

<p>If you have a Windows/Unix compatibility product on your Windows computer, SPEC recommends that you <span class="u">remove it
from your %PATH%</span> prior to installing or using SPEC OMP2012.  The reason for this recommendation is that providing a
Unix-like environment on Windows poses difficult problems.  Historically there have been various approaches, with differing
(incompatible) assumptions about how to mask or bridge differences between Windows and Unix.  The SPEC CPU toolset has its own
approach and its own set of assumptions, and there have been reports of difficult-to-diagnose errors when a Windows/Unix
compatibility product is present on the path, as described in <a class="external" href="faq.html#Run.04">faq.html</a>.  As
discussed in the faq document, if such problems occur, your first step should be to simplify the path, removing the compatibility
product.</p> 


<h3 id="dvd">B. ISO</h3>
<p>The benchmark is provided as an ISO file.  If you want, you can put it
on a DVD, and if you do, you will need a DVD drive or network access to a system that has one </p>

<h3 id="memory">C. Memory</h3>

<p>Typically 28 GB of memory will be required, exclusive of OS/overhead; but more may be required:</p>
   
   <ul>
      <li><p>The OMP2012 benchmarks (code + workload) have been designed to fit within about 28GB of physical memory.
      </p></li>


      <li><p>The 28GB of RAM for the benchmarks does not include space needed for the operating system and
      other non-SPEC tasks on the system under test.</p></li>
    
      <li><p>Attempting to run the suite with insufficient memory is strongly discouraged, as you will end up
      measuring the speed of your paging file, not the speed of your system running compute intensive workloads.</p></li>

      <li><p>More memory may be needed if you run larger thread counts, in that
additional threads may add to the requirement memory total.  </p></li>
    </ul>

<p><span class="alarm">Warning:</span> When an operating system runs out of memory, errors may occur that are difficult to
diagnose.  See the section on <a href="#resources">resources</a>, below.</p>


<h3 id="disk">D. Disk space</h3>

       <ul>
        <li><p>Typically you will need at least 8GB of disk space to install and run the suite.  However, space needs can
        vary greatly depending upon your usage and system.  The 8GB estimate is based on the following:</p>

     <ol>
        <li>Unpacked and installed, the suite takes approximately 1.5 to 2GB of disk space.</li>

        <li>When compiling your own binaries, the size of the build directories and resulting objects will vary depending
        upon your system, compiler, and compiler options.  Estimate at least 2 to 3GB of disk space per build.  If you plan
        to maintain multiple sets of binaries, each set will need space.</li>

        <li>A single run (using binaries you have built, or using pre built binaries from a separate source) takes an
        additional 2 to 3GB of disk space.  
  
     </ol></li>

        <li><p>Minimum requirement: It is possible to run with about 3GB of disk space if: 
        you delete the build directories after the build is done; and you clean run directories between tests.  See the
        discussion of disk space in <a class="external" href="runspec.html#section1.4.2">runspec.html</a> for more information
        about managing disk space.  </p></li> 
       </ul>




<h3 id="compiler">E. Compiler, or pre-compiled binaries </h3>

<p>Since SPEC supplies only source code for the benchmarks, you will need either:</p>
     <ol style="list-style:decimal">
      <li>A set of compilers for the result(s) you intend to measure:
          All three of C99, C++98 and Fortran-95 compilers

       <p>--or--</p></li>

       <li>A pre-compiled set of benchmark executables, given to you by another user of the same revision of SPEC OMP2012,
       and any run-time libraries that may be required for those executables.</li>
       </ol>

<h2 id="port">II. Portability Notes</h2>

   <p>SPEC OMP2012 is a source code benchmark, and portability of that source code is one of the chief goals of SPEC OMP2012.
   SPEC has invested substantial effort to make the benchmarks portable across a wide variety of hardware architectures,
   operating systems, and compilers.  
   </p>

   <p>Despite SPEC's testing efforts, certain portability problems are likely to arise from time to time.  For example:</p>
    <ul>

       <li> <p>Some platforms may not have a Fortran-95 compiler available.</p></li>

       <li> <p>Some older compilers may not include all the features needed to run the entire suite.</p></li>

       <li> <p>Sometimes, a new release of a compiler or operating system may introduce new behavior that is incompatible
       with one of the benchmarks.</p></li>

    </ul>

   <p>If you visit <a class="external" href="http://www.spec.org/omp2012/">http://www.spec.org/omp2012/</a>  and look up results
   for SPEC OMP2012, you will find combinations of OS and compiler versions that are known to work.  For example, if a vendor
   reports a SPEComp2012 result on the SuperHero 4 using SuperHero Unix V4.0 with SuperHero C V4.0 and SuperHero C++ V4.0, you may
   take that as an assertion by the vendor that the listed versions of Unix, C, and C++ will successfully compile and run the SPEC
   OMPG2012 suite on the listed machine.</p> 

   <p>For systems that have not (yet) been reported by vendors, SPEC can provide limited technical support to resolve portability
   issues.  See <a class="external" href="techsupport.html">techsupport.html</a> for information.</p> 


<h2 id="resources">III. About Resources and Mysterious Failures</h2>

<p><b>Resource Demand:</b>  The SPEC OMP2012 benchmarks place a significant load on your system.  Each benchmark will issues as many threads as you request
and try to
consume 100% of it (perhaps virtual).  
</p> 

<p class="snugbot">As described above, the nominal memory footprint is just under 32 GB.  Depending on your
operating system architecture, the memory may be of various types, including:</p>
<ul class="snugtop">
<li>physical memory, </li>
<li>virtual memory, and </li>
<li>swap/pagefile reservations (*);</li>
<li>process-private heap, </li>
<li>process-private stack, and</li> 
<li>process-private code;</li>
<li>operating system memory of similar types when the OS performs tasks on behalf of the process. </li>
</ul>
<p class="l2">(*)You don't want to actually <span class="u">use</span> your pagefile much, as that is a recipe for testing
your disk instead of testing your CPU.   Nevertheless, it is not uncommon for operating systems to require that pagefile
space be "reserved", and benchmarks may fail if reservations are unavailable.</p>

<p><b>Mysterious failures:</b> If an OS is unable to satisfy a resource request while your benchmarks are running, you may
encounter difficult-to-diagnose, hard-to-reproduce error messages.  Processes may be killed by the OS on a (seemingly) random
basis, or may fail to start.  If the OS is feeling sufficiently stressed, error messages may be cryptic or even non-existent.
You might, or you might not, be able to find additional detail about the resource shortages in system locations such as event
logs, message logs, or console logs.  </p>

<p class="snugbot"><b>Resource Competition:</b>  Meanwhile, contemporary systems run many tasks other than the benchmarks.
Personal systems commonly include processes that support the user, which the user may not be aware of:</p>
<ul class="snugtop">
<li>There may be virus/spyware/intrusion defenders, disk defragmenters, search indexers, bluetooth and network listeners,
license managers, software updaters, and nightly backup programs.  </li>
<li>There may be automated power-saving modes or screen savers that start when the user wanders away from the keyboard.</li>
<li>The system may be configured:
<ul><li>to download the Library of Congress once every 4 days,</li>
<li>to check for email once every 4 minutes, and</li> 
<li>to update a social media newsfeed once every 4 seconds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above may affect observed performance, and if you are unlucky, may cause hard-to-reproduce resource shortages
that prevent you from completing benchmark runs.   Therefore, you may want to consider reviewing the controls for services
such as the above, and you may want to reduce the load from these services during the benchmark run. <span class="alarm">When
you consider adjusting services, please observe these CAUTIONS:</span></p>

<ul><li><p><span class="alarm"><b>CAUTION 1</b> </span> SPEC does not endorse any particular solution to the resource problems
discussed in this section.  You need to make your own decision as to what services and programs are important.  If you turn
off something essential, and your system turns into a mushroom, <span class="u">it is not SPEC's fault</span>.  Use good
judgment about what you choose to disable.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="alarm"><b>CAUTION 2</b></span> If you choose to report results in public, you must run your system in a manner
that is documented and supported.  See the <a class="external" href="runrules.html">run rules</a> for details. </p> 
</li></ul>


<p class="snugbot">In addition, each of these techniques may improve the probability that the benchmarks have a fresh set of
dedicated resources:</p>
<ol class="snugtop">
<li>Start a new terminal window, or </li>
<li>Log out and back in, or </li>
<li>Reboot</li>
</ol>
